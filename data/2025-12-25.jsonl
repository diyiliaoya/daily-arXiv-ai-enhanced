Near-infrared Data Release 3: A Spectral Atlas and Characterization of AGN", "comment": "27 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series", "summary": "We present an analysis of near-infrared (NIR) emission-line properties, AGN diagnostics, and circumnuclear gas dynamics for 453 hard X-ray selected (14$-$195 keV) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) NIR Data Release 3 (DR3; $\\langle z \\rangle=0.036$, $z<1.0$). This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$μ$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\\geq 2 σ$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($σ=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\\lambda5007$ ($σ=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$α$ and Pa$β$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\\lambda1.257$$μ$m/Pa$β$ and H$_2$ $λ2.122$$μ$m/Br$γ$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available. Additionally, we find a moderate correlation ($p \\approx 7.4 \\times 10^{-3}$) between hot molecular gas mass (traced by H$_2$ 2.121$μ$m) and X-ray luminosity, while its relation with Eddington ratio is weaker. The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback. Our results underscore the value of NIR spectroscopy in probing AGN activity, obscured BLRs, and the complex interactions between AGN and their circumnuclear environments."}

By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies."}

Space weather and its potential negative consequences for life on Earth has received increasing attention in recent decades. Particularly predicting CME onset has become important from a security perspective. To predict CMEs, one must first understand the dynamics leading to pre-eruptive magnetic field configurations such as flux ropes.\n  Aims. In this study, we investigate the realistic formation of coronal flux ropes above the solar photosphere. The aim is to find if and how flux ropes can form there, and how the formation is related to flux cancellation at the photosphere.\n  Methods. We run a convective non-symmetric 3D radiative MHD simulation with the code Bifrost. A linear force-free field with sheared coronal arcades is slowly inserted in the 24Mmx24Mmx30Mm simulation box. After this, the self-consistent stochastic plasma flows of the convection zone drive several small-scale flux cancellations and magnetic reconnection, without external influence. Lagrangian markers called corks are used to track the dynamic evolution of the magnetic field. Results. Over a period of 2.5 h, a flux rope is generated with photospheric footpoints separated by up to 12Mm. The flux rope forms gradually through several individual events, such as slipping reconnection, U-loop emergence, and thick-photosphere tether-cutting reconnection.\n  Conclusions. Flux ropes can be formed in the solar atmosphere solely driven by convection and flux cancellations at the photosphere. However, not all flux cancellations contribute to the build-up of the flux rope, and some coronal reconnection events that do are not clearly related to flux cancellation. The formation process of flux ropes from coronal sheared arcades driven by convection is therefore more complex than in the original smooth flux cancellation model. But the end result is qualitatively the same. Flux cancellation works. A flux rope is formed."}

Scattering is strongly forward-peaked, yielding momentum-transfer cross sections substantially smaller than commonly assumed: mass-scaling from O/C--CO$_2$ systems overestimates H--CO$_2$ total cross sections by factors of 30--45, while existing empirical fits underestimate the low-energy regime by up to $\\sim$45\\%.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence."}

Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($τ_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $α$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto τ_D^α$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology."}

By combining new \\textit{TESS} photometry with archival spectroscopy, our dynamical analysis shows that the system's three components share similar masses, radii, and luminosities within errors, occupying coincident Hertzsprung--Russell diagram positions, indicative of coeval evolution. By fitting seven observed $δ$ Scuti frequencies through asteroseismic modeling with dynamically constrained theoretical grids, we simultaneously trace the pulsating star's evolution and constrain the triple system's evolutionary stage, with the derived fundamental parameters showing consistency with the dynamical solutions.

Additionally, the $δ$ Scuti component shows multiple non-radial modes with significant mixed-character frequencies, providing precise constraints on its convective core extent ($R_{\\mathrm{cz}}/R = 0.0562^{+0.0137}_{-0.0021}$)."}

To be published in the Proceedings of Science https://pos.sissa.it/493/", "summary": "The disc instability model successfully reproduces many of the observed properties of cataclysmic variables. However, additional ingredients such as mass-transfer variations, disc irradiation, stream-disc overflow, or inner-disc truncation must be included to explain certain systems. The physics underlying these processes is often poorly constrained, and our lack of knowledge is typically absorbed into extra free parameters, much like the $α$-prescription for viscosity. In this paper, I examine how each of these ingredients affects the predicted light curves and discuss the limitations that arise from the growing number of unconstrained parameters on the model's predictive power."}

Using high-resolution optical and near-infrared ($H$ and $K$ band) spectra from FEROS and IGRINS, we determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for 23 elements (Li, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, Ce, Nd, Yb, and Pb). This includes species not yet studied in this cluster, such as F, P, K, Yb, and Pb, as well as oxygen isotopic ratios $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O. Membership was assessed using astrometry and chemical abundances, providing insight into the evolutionary stages of Li-enriched giants and cluster parameters (age, distance, extinction). However, the identification of Ba-stars remains challenging due to their binary nature and less reliable astrometric solutions. The cluster's abundances are broadly consistent with expectations for the Galactic thin disk. The mean fluorine abundance agrees with chemical evolution models predicting that young clusters (<2 Gyr) exhibit elevated [F/Fe], with production from SN II, SN Ia, AGB, and Wolf-Rayet stars. No distinct chemical or rotational features were found to explain the lithium enrichment, likely occurring either during the red clump phase or near the RGB tip. For the Ba-stars, nucleosynthesis models combined with the cluster's turn-off mass suggest polluting companion masses of 3.00 and 3.75 $M_{\\odot}$ for stars #002 and #201. These results highlight the importance of open clusters as laboratories for chemically peculiar stars."}

The pulsation period is found to have shortened by about 3 days over the past two centuries. Superimposed on the mean period are clear modulations on timescales of approximately 35 and 98 years. The depths of extrema show non-random behaviour: minima in particular display strong similarity in depth over extended intervals, with a mean depth difference of 0.26 magnitude for adjacent minima compared to a 0.38 magnitude difference for random pairs. Depth coherence persists for up to about 43 years. Examination of extrema depths over the full observational history of the star reveals gradual long-term changes, consistent with evolution of the circumstellar dust environment."}

We present new measurements of SO$_2$ ice from 6.8-8.5 $μ$m toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 $L_\\odot$ (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 $L_\\odot$ (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 $μ$m CH$_4$ band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO$_2$ feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO$_2$ laboratory ices were tested: pure SO$_2$ ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO$_2$ ice (lower and upper limits); CH$_3$OH:SO$_2$ ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H$_2$O:SO$_2$ ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO$_2$ ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO$_2$ in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO$_2$ ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO$_2$ as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding ``missing sulfur'' problem."}
