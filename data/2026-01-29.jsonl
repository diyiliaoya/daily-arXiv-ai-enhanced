In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $α$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N ~ 100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N ~ 30."}

In this review, we provide an overview of the current status of LPV studies, focusing on their observational properties and applications, including:\n  - Modern classification of LPVs into Miras, semiregular variables (SRVs), and OGLE small-amplitude red giants (OSARGs), which occupy multiple period-luminosity sequences associated with different pulsation modes, chemical compositions, and evolutionary stages\n  - Mira variables as reliable distance indicators across diverse stellar environments and their increasing role as standard candles\n  - The increasing role of SRVs and OSARGs\n  - Long secondary period (LSP) variables as potential tracers of exoplanets\n  Together with advances in theoretical modeling, these developments establish LPVs as valuable tracers of Galactic structure, stellar populations, and the extragalactic distance scale."}

None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions.

To follow the stellar rotation as a function of age, we consider vbroad as a function of scaled age-stellar age divided by the relevant Terminal Age Main Sequence (MS), for four narrow mass bins. We find that stellar rotation deceleration is slow during the MS phase and fast afterwards for stars hotter than the break, whereas deceleration rate is relatively high and does not vary much for the cool stars. Our findings are consistent with the theory that stellar rotation slowing is due to magnetic breaking, emanating from magnetic fields that are anchored to the stellar convective envelopes. Therefore, deceleration is high in cool stars, but in hot stars only after they leave the MS and develop convective outer layers"}

The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers. This paper summarizes the PBR payload and its expected performance."}

Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr."}

The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \\times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \\times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \\times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \\times 10^4 - 5 \\times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field."}

We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided."}

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors."}

In this paper we describe a method by which the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could detect such moons: broadband reflected-light lunar eclipses (e.g., the moon passing into the shadow of the planet). We find that an Earth-like moon orbiting a Jovian-size planet at 1au can outshine its host planet near 1 micron, producing frequent (days time-scale) lunar eclipses with depths of order 50%. We determine that single eclipse events out to $\\sim$12pc may be detectable for Earth-like moons around giant planets, down to $0.9R_\\oplus$. Detection of smaller moons, $\\sim$0.5$R_\\oplus$ (corresponding to about the size of Mars or Ganymede), may be possible, but would generally require multiple events for most systems. These several-hour events provide a clear pathway to detecting habitable moons with HWO, given sufficient stare-time on each system to detect lunar eclipses. The occurrence rate of habitable exomoons remains unconstrained, however, making the ultimate yield uncertain. HWO will be capable of placing the first meaningful constraints on the frequency of habitable exomoons around giant planets; if it is non-negligible, HWO could also search for life on these worlds, possibly with lunar eclipse spectroscopy."}

Simulations of sunquake excitation suggest co-excitation with wavefronts propagating in the corona and chromosphere, similar to Moreton-Ramsey waves, and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). To investigate observational evidence for the particle-driven mechanism in LCPFs, we compare populations of events associated with and without coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are known to generate similar EUV shock waves. We employ a visual inspection of flare events that generate LCPFs using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) coronagraph images to find that coronal waves associated with CMEs propagate noticeably faster. Then we examine GOES soft X-ray (SXR) data of standalone flare events (those that generate coronal waves without CMEs), focusing on soft X-ray (SXR) characteristics related to magnetic energy release rate. This reveals that such standalone or confined flares differ from sunquake flares: they are less impulsive and energetic than sunquake flares. However, they are more impulsive but less energetic than LCPF-associated flares with a CME. In particular, coronal waves accompanied by CMEs exhibit significantly higher volume emission measures, suggesting a different generation mechanism."}

Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations.

We analyse hot FUV lines such C IV, Si IV, and N V, as well as fluorescent emission from H2. Despite evidence for accretion, the C IV line profiles are narrower than in typical classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), resembling weak-lined T Tauri stars more closely. Additionally, the C IV integrated line flux does not follow the level expected of an accreting object in the magnetically saturated regime. However, comparing J0844 to appropriate low mass analogs, J0844 does show excess C IV emission characteristic of accretion, suggesting the magnetic saturation level may need to be redefined for the lowest mass objects. The C IV/Si IV emission line ratio is found to be 20, which is higher than most CTTSs, with a few exceptions (e.g., TW Hya). We fit the STIS optical spectrum to calculate an accretion rate, which we find to be 4.2 x 10-11 Msol/yr. The accretion rate found based on the empirical LCIV-Macc relationship is twoorders of magnitude higher, suggesting this relationship may not hold at the lowest masses. We find the H2 emission appears to originate within the co-rotation radius, pointing to either disc truncation well inside the co-rotation radius or additional sources of H2 emission that we do not consider (e.g., from the accretion flow itself). These data provide an extension of our current understanding of accretion and inner disc conditions to the relatively unexplored lowest mass regime."}

In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*."}

Despite recent progress, the dynamical stability of these systems remains only partially understood. Numerical simulations have established a general exponential increase in system lifetime with orbital separation, with mean-motion resonances playing a key role in regulating stability. Tightly packed three-planet systems exhibit a distinctive behavior not seen in higher-multiplicity systems: a small yet significant region of phase space is anomalously stable. This study investigates the dynamics of extremely compact three-planet systems, focusing on anomalously long-lived configurations and their connection to resonant chains observed in exoplanetary systems. We perform numerical integrations of coplanar, initially circular, equal-mass three-planet systems over stellar-lifetime timescales and at high resolution in orbital separation, and interpret the results in the context of recent analytical work. We identify regions of phase space hosting anomalously stable orbits, including systems surviving multiple orders of magnitude longer than predicted by the exponential trend. We demonstrate a clear link between stability and isolated three-body mean-motion resonances, showing that extremely compact systems can remain stable when captured into a small subset of isolated zeroth-order resonances. Stability further depends on the initial orbital longitudes and on the interplay between the three-body and two-body resonance networks."}

The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\\star\\sim10^{5.6}\\ M_\\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted.

Hogg", "Andrew Sayjdari", "Lily Zhao"], "title": "A constrained linear model for continuum normalization of stellar spectra", "comment": "AAS accepted", "summary": "Inferring stellar parameters and chemical abundances by forward modeling stellar spectra usually requires a spectral synthesis code, or an emulator constructed from a curated training set. In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $α$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N ~ 100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N ~ 30."}

This theory, however, cannot naturally account for the formation timescale of ice giants or the existence of diverse exoplanetary systems. Planetary migration is a key to resolving these problems. One well-known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering of planetesimals. In our previous paper (Jinno et al. 2024, PASJ, 76, 1309), we investigated the migration of a single planet through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Here we perform the first high-resolution simulations of planet formation from a large-scale planetesimal disk, incorporating planet-gas disk interactions, planet-planetesimal interactions, gravitational interactions among all planetesimals, and physical collisions between planetesimals to investigate the role of PDM in the planet formation process. Our results show that protoplanets undergo dynamic inward/outward migrations during the runaway growth stage via PDM. Moreover, orbital repulsion combined with PDM tends to make two groups of protoplanets, outer ones going outward and inner ones going inward. Such dynamic migration significantly influences the early stages of planetary formation. These findings provide a viable pathway for the formation of Earth-like planets and ice giants' cores. Furthermore, they suggest that a standard protoplanetary disk model can account for the planetary migration necessary to explain diverse exoplanetary systems without the need for additional hypotheses."}

Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks."}

We aim to assess whether the beacon induced any perturbation in another oxygen species, namely CO. A second goal is to measure how the vortex perturbed the stratospheric wind regime.

We used a previously determined CO vertical profile as a template, to search for (i) the meridional distribution of CO and (ii) variations of the CO abundance associated with the storm. The high spatial and spectral resolutions of the ALMA observations enabled us to retrieve the winds from the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the lines. Despite limitations resulting from the removal of baseline ripples, we find a relatively constant meridional distribution of CO.

For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination.

We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe>0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth."}

Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\\star\\simeq10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\\mathrm{H2}<7\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$α$ and H$α$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations."}

Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr."}

Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Together, these contributions form an integrated framework advancing the search for life beyond Earth."}

Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\\sim5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. This outflow has a characteristic velocity of $170\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$, an outflow mass rate of $700\\,M_\\odot/\\mathrm{yr}$, a depletion time of $16\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$, and energetics consistent with star formation as a driver. The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$α$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration."}

Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations. We suggest that either the H$_2^{18}$O-rich water has been removed from the emitting region and replaced by H$_2^{18}$O-poor water formed by reactions with $^{18}$O-poor CO, or that the gas-phase water is depleted in $^{18}$O via mass-dependent fractionation processes at the water snowline."}

This work investigates whether metallic (M-type) asteroids exhibit systematically higher rotation rates than the broader asteroid population. Using recent Mahlke's taxonomy and a multi-method statistical approach that combines classical hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and resampling techniques, we consistently find evidence that metallic asteroids rotate, on average, faster. The results remain robust across different ways of controlling for asteroid size and sampling biases. While limitations remain due to sample size, heterogeneous data sources, and possible selection effects, the convergence of independent methods strengthens the conclusion that metallic composition is associated with higher rotation rates. This finding supports the hypothesis that metallic bodies possess greater internal cohesion, with implications for the formation and collisional evolution of small bodies in the Solar System."}

We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \\lesssim M_{\\rm gal} \\lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed."}

Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks."}

Using the optical spectrometer Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we carry out a pilot study on high-resolution phase curve spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9 b. We spectrally and temporally resolve its dayside emission from post-transit to pre-eclipse (orbital phase phi = 0.1 - 0.45). The signal strength and width increase with orbital phases as the dayside rotates into view. The net Doppler shift varies progressively from -13.4 +/- 0.6 to -0.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, the extent of which exceeds its rotation velocity of 6.4 +/- 0.1 km/s, providing unambiguous evidence of atmospheric winds. We devise a retrieval framework to fit the full time-series spectra, accounting for the variation of line profiles due to the rotation and winds. We retrieve a supersonic day-to-night wind speed up to 11.7 +/- 0.6 km/s on the emerging dayside, representing the most extreme atmospheric winds in hot Jupiters to date. Comparison to 3D circulation models reveals a weak atmospheric drag, consistent with relatively efficient heat recirculation as also supported by space-based phase curve measurements. Additionally, we retrieve the dayside chemistry (including Fe i, Fe ii, Ti i, Ti ii, Ca i, Ca ii, Mg i, and Si i) and temperature structure, and place constraints on the nightside thermal profile. Our high-resolution phase curve spectra and the measured supersonic winds provide excellent benchmarks for extreme physics in circulation models, demonstrating the power of this technique in understanding climates of hot Jupiters."}

One candidate mechanism is rotational emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can have the necessary electric dipole moment and size distribution to account for the AME in representative interstellar environments. However, previous investigations have found that AME is better correlated with the far-infrared dust emission rather than the PAH emission. In this work we analyze the correlations between the AME and the PAH and far-infrared dust emission using the 3.3 $μ$m PAH emission feature as observed by band 3 of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This analysis builds on previous work conducted in individual molecular clouds and extends it into fainter, more diffuse structures. In addition, we utilize the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE reduction for this work, building on previous studies that used the original DIRBE data set. We find that the AME is better correlated with far-infrared dust emission ($ρ\\sim$0.9) than the PAH emission ($ρ\\sim$0.7) in the central $|b|\\leq$ 10\\degree\\ region of the sky. This could indicate either that non-PAH dust grains or an alternative physical emission mechanism is primarily responsible for the AME in the Galactic Plane, or that the excitation conditions for mid-infrared emission and for AME from PAHs differ substantially."}

We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\\ h^{-1}M_\\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets.

Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks."}

We use proper motions combined with backward orbit integration in a semi-analytic potential to constrain plausible interaction scenarios for Pisces and And XVI. Both dwarfs are currently M31 satellites, defined as being inside its virial radius. However, our results show that, in our fiducial mass models, 42% (And XVI) and 60% (Pisces) of dwarf orbits support that they were previously satellites of M33 (i.e., once inside its virial radius). Both dwarfs had fly-by encounters with M33 at relative velocities greater than M33's escape speed within the past 1-2 Gyr. In over 70% of orbits, Pisces and And XVI also had a close approach with each other post-M33 interaction and share an orbital plane, suggesting possible past group accretion. We explore a range of mass combinations for M31 and M33, finding that this primarily regulates the likelihood that the dwarfs were satellites of M33 in the past, while upholding conclusions of recent flybys about M33. These close interactions provide new evidence for past satellite exchange and/or group infall scenarios between M31 and M33. Such interactions also affect comparisons to observational surveys that define satellites primarily by their distance relative to host galaxies."}

We used a NIR flux-color cut to match faint SCUBA-2 sources to red stellar counterparts with existing spectroscopic redshifts, allowing us to target CO lines at known frequencies. We obtained seven new CO detections and a serendipitous [C I] detection in an off-axis source, and measured molecular gas masses of $M_{\\rm mol} = (6-22)\\times10^{10}~(α_{\\rm CO}/3.6)~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ from these lines.

However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's \"impossibly early\" galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of $3-4$. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr."}

Surface helium abundances in Galactic O-type stars: indications for identifying binary interaction products", "comment": "Submitted to A&A on 2026, January 18th. Comments welcome", "summary": "The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction -- particularly mass-transfer episodes -- may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe>0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth."}
