Here we bridge these scales by embedding a first-principles, GRMHD-informed prescription for black hole accretion and feedback--derived from multi-zone simulations that self-consistently connect inflows and outflows from the horizon to the Bondi radius--within cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of $\\sim10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$ halos. These GRMHD results predict a \"suppressed Bondi\" regime in which magnetic stresses and relativistic winds strongly reduce effective accretion rates in a spin-dependent manner. We find that black holes cannot grow efficiently by accretion until they exceed $\\sim10^{7}\\,M_\\odot$, regardless of the feedback strength. Beyond this threshold, systems bifurcate: low-spin ($η\\!\\sim\\!0.02$) black holes continue to accrete without quenching star formation, while high-spin ($η\\!\\gtrsim\\!0.3$) black holes quench effectively but become starved of further growth. Early, massive seeding partially alleviates this tension through merger-driven assembly, yet an additional cold or super-Eddington accretion mode appears essential to reproduce the observed SMBH population and the empirical black hole--galaxy scaling relations. Our results demonstrate that GRMHD-informed feedback models can account for the maintenance-mode behavior of low-luminosity AGN like M87*, but cannot by themselves explain the full buildup of SMBH mass across cosmic time. A unified, multi-regime framework is required to capture the evolving interplay between spin-dependent feedback, cold inflows, and mergers in driving co-evolution."}

However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z < 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources."}

These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions.

Characterising the atmosphere of this world is the key to understanding what processes dominate in creating the hot Neptune desert. We aim to characterise the reflected light of LTT-9779 b at high spectral resolution to break the degeneracy between clouds and atmospheric metallicity. This is key to interpreting its mass loss history which may illuminate how it kept its place in the desert. We use the high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy technique on four half-nights of ESPRESSO observations in 4-UT mode (16.4-m effective mirror) to constrain the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b. We do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b despite these data having the expected sensitivity at the level 100 ppm. Injection tests on the post-eclipse data indicate that TiO should have been detected for a range of different equilibrium chemistry models. Therefore this non-detection suggests TiO depletion in the western hemisphere however, this conclusion is sensitive to temperature which impacts the chemistry in the upper atmosphere and the reliability of the line list. Additionally, we are able to constrain the top of the western cloud deck to $P_{\\text{top, western}}<10^{-2.0}$ bar and the top of the eastern cloud deck $P_{\\text{top, eastern}}<10^{-0.5}$ bar, which is consistent with the predicted altitude of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds from JWST NIRISS/SOSS. While we do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b, we have verified that this technique can be used in practice to characterise the high spectral resolution reflected light of exoplanets so long as their spectra contain a sufficient number of deep spectral lines. Therefore this technique may become an important cornerstone of exoplanet characterisation with the ELT and beyond."}

This representative XRG sample includes 15 XRGs newly reported here, which we selected from the LOTSS-DR2 survey, following well-defined criteria. The evidence for in-situ particle acceleration comes from the observed cessation of steepening, or even flattening (i.e., gradient reversal) of the spectral index profile along the lobe into the associated wing, as determined here by combining the LoTSS-DR2 (144 MHz) and FIRST (1.4 GHz) maps. Interestingly, the afore-mentioned trends in spectral gradient, indicative of in-situ particle acceleration, are mostly found to set in near the region where the lobe plasma stream bends to connect to the wing. Such a spatial coincidence with bending of radio lobe/tail has been noticed in recent years for just a couple of radio galaxies. The large increase in such examples, as reported here, is expected to give a fillip to observational, theoretical and numerical simulation follow-up investigations of this important clue about the occurrence of in-situ particle acceleration in lobes of radio galaxies."}

We examine Jn sensitivity limits obtained from simulations of candidate UOP trajectories, pairing these with Uranus interior and wind models to perform retrievals from the gravity moments. We consider zonal wind profiles derived from recent feature-tracking data, assuming that zonal winds extend into the planet along cylinders, with a radial decay function similar to those that explain Jupiter and Saturn gravity. Present knowledge of J2 and J4 permits a fairly wide range of possible wind depths in Uranus, up to 1,800 km or 7% by radius. Measuring additional gravity moments is essential to separate this unknown wind depth from other interior properties of interest, but J6 is found to be too dominated by bulk rotation to be a useful probe of the wind depth. Odd moments arising from Uranus's observed north-south asymmetric flow are strong functions of the wind depth, but the usefulness of J3 is hindered by its sensitivity to present uncertainties in the wind profile. The even moment J8, or the odd moments J5 and J7, are the best probes of the depth of Uranus's winds. J8, and most likely J5 and J7, are measurable in a highly inclined orbit making >~10 pericenter passages inward of the $ζ$ ring, approximately 1,000-2,500 km above Uranus's cloud tops."}

We analyze a 3D MHD model of a multistrand flux tube in a stratified solar atmosphere, driven by twisting motions at the boundaries. We show how the magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time, by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection. We forward-modelled optically thin emission with SDO/AIA and MUSE and compared the synthetic observations with the intrinsic coronal plasma properties, focusing on the response to impulsive coronal heating.

A significantly larger number of identified GPs in the Local Universe might provide a better characterization of their high-redshift analogs and Lyman continuum escape. In this paper, we confront the challenges of robustly identifying GPs without spectroscopic information, a needed approach considering the incompleteness of spectroscopic surveys for compact sources. The principal difficulty stems from a significant contamination of photometric candidates by stars and quasars of similar color. To solve this, we introduce an SED matching method, which separates candidate GPs from contaminants on the basis of SDSS and WISE photometry of spectroscopically confirmed stars, quasars and galaxies. The method has an effectiveness of 85%, and a contamination rate of ~10%. With it we identify ~9600 GP candidates expected to lie in the 0.12 < z < 0.36 range - a tenfold increase over what would be selected using SDSS DR18 spectra. Some of the new GPs are as bright as r~19, and 1200 are predicted to have [OIII]5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 A. The new population contains many \"Extended Peas\", which are absent among known GPs and possibly represent merging systems. We provide catalogs containing 8313 newly identified GP candidates, as well as 917 GPs confirmed using SDSS spectroscopy and 521 GPs with spectroscopic redshifts from LAMOST and other sources."}

Rafikov"], "title": "Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem", "comment": "5 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome", "summary": "The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation. In fact, the energy of relative motion is not conserved due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling."}

Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors ($f_{\\rm Edd} < 3 \\times 10^{-3}$) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed $z = 0$ SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At $z > 6$, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models."}

In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives.

The enhanced carbon emission in J1615 may result from a combination of lower accretion rate and larger and more processed dust grains in the inner disk, conditions that together may allow carbon-rich gas to persist and be detected. These results expand the sample of protoplanetary disks around solar-mass stars with strong CO2 and C2H2 emission and identify J1615 as a carbon-rich transitional disk, providing new insights into the chemical diversity of planet-forming environments."}

We show that, under dark conditions, these devices are generation recombination (GR) noise dominated down to 0.1 Hz and, under optical load, they are likely dominated by GR and photon noise down to tenths of a Hz and possibly lower, both in spite of the use of a-Si:H PPCs.

The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses.

We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$α$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer."}

Soda-lime glass and quartz sand targets were used for comparison. The developed sand model successfully reproduced the sound velocity measured in an experimental study. Using the new sand model, the crater formation was simulated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with a material strength parameter.

How such a shock is launched and propagates through the star is a decade-long puzzle. Some models assume that the shock can be reenergized by absorbing neutrinos, leading to highly aspherical explosions. Other models involve jet-powered shocks that lead to bipolar explosions reflected in the geometry of the shock-breakout emission. We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting ~1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion. These findings suggest that the physical mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars manifests a well-defined axial symmetry and acts on large scales."}

To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn.

Multiple possible seeding pathways have been proposed across a variety of mass scales, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One such channel is a direct collapse black hole (DCBH), thought to form from the deaths of supermassive stars in pristine atomic cooling halos in the early universe. In this work, we investigate the ability to identify halos likely to form a DCBH based on their properties using a support vector machine (SVM). We implement multiple methods to improve the accuracy of the model, including selecting subsets of critical features and optimizing SVM hyperparameters. We find that our best model requires quantities relevant to star formation, such as the metallicity, incident flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, and halo stellar mass. The SVMs produced from this work can serve as probabilistic and holistic seeding prescriptions for DCBHs in cosmological simulations."}

The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as \"digging a dark hole\", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V<3, a resolved stellar diameter <2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions.

The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE."}

Here we introduce JW-Flare, the first Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) explicitly trained for solar flare forecasting through fine-tuning on textual physic parameters of solar active regions and magnetic field images. This method demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for large flares prediction on the test dataset.

This study marks a substantial advance in both the scale and accuracy of solar flare forecasting and opens a promising avenue for AI-driven methodologies in broader scientific domains."}

The contribution of synthetic data generation of HSTDM observation includes two parts: 1. HSTDM instrumental effect simulation based on both real testing profiles and simulated models; 2.

By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov--Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson--Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \\simeq -0.335\\,\\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called \"gravothermal catastrophe\"). In this work, we assume $E>E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov--Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat. Furthermore, we show that an isothermal gas sphere of strictly constant density is an impossibility. This exposition emphasizes some of the deep connections and self-consistency between kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and stellar structure, while highlighting some formal aspects of classical astrophysical models."}

The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as \"digging a dark hole\", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V<3, a resolved stellar diameter <2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions. We discuss the need for higher-contrast observations to sufficiently vet these reference star candidates prior to Roman Coronagraph observations along with the implications of reference star criteria on observation planning for Roman and HWO."}

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations."}

First, Fe abundance rises with $σ$, but only until $σ\\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $σ< 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$σ$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported."}

We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift.

To manage the high count rates in large flares, an attenuator is typically placed in front of the HXR detectors. However, this significantly limits the spectral diagnostic capabilities at lower energies, and consequently, it restricts the analysis of the lower temperatures in flares. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter mission was designed to observe solar flares in hard X-rays. The imaging detectors use an attenuator during periods of high flux level. In contrast, the background (BKG) detector of STIX is never covered by the attenuator and is therefore dedicated to measure the unattenuated flux using differently sized apertures placed in front of the detector. We aim to demonstrate that joint spectral fitting using different detector configurations of STIX allows us to reliably diagnose both the hot and the superhot components in large flares. We jointly fit the HXR spectra of the STIX BKG detector and the STIX imaging detectors using SUNKIT-SPEX software package to determine the spectral parameters of both the hot and superhot thermal components in solar flares. Using joint fitting on 32 STIX flares, we corroborate that for GOES X-class flares, the HXR spectrum is better represented by two thermal components instead of an isothermal component. At the temperature peak time, the superhot HXR flux above 15 keV is typically stronger than the hot HXR flux. The GOES long-wavelength channel is dominated by the hot component with a superhot contribution up to 10%. This paper demonstrates that joint spectral fitting of the same detector type with different attenuation schemes is a simple and powerful method to monitor multithermal flare plasma."}

The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic.

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Molecular gas traces both the fuel for star formation and the processes that regulate it. Observing its physical state (e.g., excitation) reveals when and why galaxies stop forming stars. We observed the CO(5-4) emission of 8 post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.6-1.3. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high-J transitions are probed for quiescent galaxies beyond the local Universe. All targets are detected in CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) and have molecular gas fractions up to 20%. Using the ratio R52=L'CO(5-4)/L'CO(2-1) as a proxy for gas excitation, we test how quenching occurs. Low R52 values would indicate suppressed fractions of dense/warm gas relative to cold and diffuse gas, while ratios typical of main-sequence galaxies would imply that quenching is still ongoing and that star formation may exhaust the remaining gas. On average our post-starbursts have R52 = 0.31, comparable to high-redshift galaxies. However, CO(5-4) non-detections, corresponding to galaxies without signs of interaction, yield R52<0.11, 2 times lower than local star-forming galaxies. The average CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) peaks at J = 3, similar to the Milky Way. Three galaxies show signs of ongoing mergers and have R52 = 0.49 and CO SLEDs peaking at J > 4-5, similar to high-redshift galaxies. At least one requires additional mechanisms (AGN, shocks) to explain the rise of the SLED up to J=5. CO excitation helps distinguishing among mechanisms driving the low star formation efficiency (SFE) of post-starburst galaxies. The low SFE might be due to high kinetic temperatures and low gas densities yielding high excitation, or due to low gas densities implying low excitation. On average, our sample favours the latter scenario, suggesting that gas stabilization, feedback, or stripping are needed to keep galaxies quiescent, and that residual star formation alone cannot deplete the remaining molecular gas."}

Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027.

To achieve this, we utilized approximately 2 million spectroscopy pairwise combinations observed across different epochs for $\\sim90,000$ AGNs. We estimate the ensemble variability structure function (SF) for subsamples categorized by various AGN properties, such as black hole mass, AGN luminosity ($L$), and Eddington ratio, to investigate how AGN variability depends on these parameters. We found that the SFs are strongly correlated with $L$, Eddington ratio, and rest-frame wavelength ($λ$). The analysis, with each parameter held fixed, reveals that SFs depend primarily on $L$ and $λ$, but not on the Eddington ratio. Consequently, under the assumption that AGNs follow a universal SF, we found that the variability timescale ($τ$) is proportional to both $L$ and $λ$, expressed as $τ\\propto L^{0.62\\pm0.07} λ^{1.74\\pm0.23}$. This result is broadly consistent with predictions from the standard accretion disk model ($τ\\propto L^{0.5} λ^{2}$). However, when considering only shorter wavelengths ($λ\\leq 3050$ Å) to minimize contamination from the host galaxy and the Balmer continuum, the power-law index for $λ$ drops significantly to $1.12 \\pm 0.24$. This value is lower than predicted by approximately $3-$4\\ σ$, suggesting that the radial temperature profile may be systematically steeper than that predicted by the standard disk model, although other mechanisms may also contribute to this discrepancy. These findings highlight the power of temporal spectroscopic data in probing AGN variability, as they allow robust estimation of continuum fluxes without interference from strong emission lines."}

A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$σ$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($α$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E>6.8\\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($α= -0.81 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$σ$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($α$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E>6.8\\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($α= -0.81 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift."}

A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set.

The accurate interpretation of the processes underlying the radio signatures requires a detailed characterisation of the stellar magnetism. We study two M dwarfs, StKM 1-1262 (M0 type, P$_\\mathrm{rot}=1.24$ d) and V374 Peg (M4 type, P$_\\mathrm{rot}=0.4455$ d), which were detected with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). StKM 1-1262 exhibited a type-II radio burst, potentially resulting from a coronal mass ejection event. V374 Peg manifested low-frequency radio emission typical of an electron-cyclotron maser instability emission mechanism. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of these M dwarfs collected with the SpectroPolarimètre InfraRouge (SPIRou). Firstly, we refined the stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, and measured the average surface magnetic flux via modelling of Zeeman broadening in unpolarised spectra. We then applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging to least-squares deconvolution line profiles in circular polarisation to reconstruct their large-scale magnetic fields. StKM 1-1262 has a total, unsigned magnetic field of $3.53\\pm0.06$ kG on average and the large-scale magnetic field topology is dipolar and moderately axisymmetric, with an average strength of 300 G. V374 Peg has an unsigned magnetic field of $5.46\\pm0.09$ kG and the large-scale field is dipolar and axisymmetric, with an average strength of 800 G. For StKM 1-1262, we found a strong anti-correlation between the total magnetic field and the effective temperature which is reminiscent of the tight link between small-scale magnetic fields and surface inhomogeneities. For V374 Peg, we found a moderate anti-correlation, possibly due to a more even distribution of surface features. (Abridged)"}

By studying the continuum and emission line variability of WPVS 48, we aim to infer the BLR size as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We analyse data from a dedicated optical spectroscopic reverberation mapping campaign of WPVS 48 taken with the 10 m Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) at 24 epochs over a period of 7 months between December 2013 and June 2014. WPVS 48 shows variability throughout the campaign. We find a stratified BLR, where the variability amplitude of the integrated emission lines decreases with distance to the ionizing continuum source. Specifically, the variable emission of H$α$, H$β$, H$γ$, He I $\\lambda5876$ originates at distances of $16.0^{+4.0}_{-2.0}$, $15.0^{+4.5}_{-1.9}$, $12.5^{+3.5}_{-2.5}$ and $14.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1}$ light-days, respectively, to the optical continuum at 5100 A.

In this study, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to estimate this probability as a function of the jet opening angle and the ratio between the jet length and the separation between stars.

Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region.

We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $α$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment."}

As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives.

The LRDs appearing as ``Chimeras\" like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M_{\\bullet}\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_{\\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\\mathscr{M}_{m_{\\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$β$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M_{\\bullet}<\\mathscr{M}_{m_{\\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves."}

First, Fe abundance rises with $σ$, but only until $σ\\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $σ< 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$σ$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported."}

The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as \"digging a dark hole\", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V<3, a resolved stellar diameter <2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions.

For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $α_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $α_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $α_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $α_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $α_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH. In the near future, to detect and report periodic variations of $α_{5100}$ for sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN should be our main objective. The results provide a new method by applications of properties of optical continuum emissions for detecting sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN."}

This survey promises to revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by observing $\\sim$10$^8$ galaxies with low spectral resolution. A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set. We obtain median bias, scatter and percentage of outliers $μ$ = (0.01 dex, 0.00 dex, 0.00 mag), $σ_{NMAD}$ = (0.23 dex, 0.29 dex, 0.04 mag), f$_{o}$ = (17 %, 24 %, 1 %) at $ i \\sim$17 mag for age, metallicity and dust attenuation, respectively. The accuracy of the predictions is highly dependent on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the photometry, achieving robust predictions up to $i$ $\\sim$ 20 mag."}

Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Warped structures are often observed in disk galaxies, yet their physical origin is still under investigation. We present a systematic study of warped edge-on disk galaxies based on imaging data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8, with the expectation that this large sample size, enabled by wide-area surveys, will offer new perspectives on the formation of disk warps. Using a deep learning approach, we trained an EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network to classify the morphology of edge-on-disk galaxies into warped and non-warped categories. Our model was trained on a curated and visually verified set of labeled galaxy images and applied to a large dataset of over 595,651 edge-on disk galaxies selected from the Galaxy Zoo DESI catalog. Our results provide the largest warp catalog to date, consisting of 23996 warped edge-on disk galaxies, and reveal statistical trends between warp occurrence and galaxy properties. Compared to their non-warped counterparts, these warped disk galaxies tend to have bluer colors, lower stellar masses, higher gas fractions and star-formation rates, smaller Sérsic indices and larger disk sizes. In addition, warped disk galaxies show higher projected number densities of neighboring galaxies than their non-warped counterparts, particularly within \\( R_{\\mathrm{proj}} \\lesssim 50~\\mathrm{kpc} \\), where the local number density is roughly twice as high."}

Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ and $5.7 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys."}
