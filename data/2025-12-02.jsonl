However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing. We strive to explain the 9 components of one frequency multiplet, identified as a low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We update the frequencies of the quadrupole mode under investigation using a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve, showing that an internal magnetic field is required to simultaneously explain all 9 components. We implement theoretical pulsation computations applicable to the low-order modes of a beta Cep pulsator including the Coriolis force, as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply the theoretical description to perform asteroseismic modelling of the amplitudes and frequencies in the multiplet of the quadrupole g-mode of this evolved beta Cep star. Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of about 5.3 d and the Lorentz force due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of around 24 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes. Given the stellar mass of about 12 solar masses, this work presents the detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor."}

These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star."}

The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step."}

While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $ρ= 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\\sim$297 AU, $\\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations."}

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $μ$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT."}

The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6\" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14\" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11\" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10\" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars."}

Interstellar dust is also directly observed in the vicinity of the Sun with dust detectors onboard spacecraft, and it is known to be affected by the interplanetary magnetic field. The main goal of this work is to show how the change in the interplanetary magnetic field with the solar cycle affects the infrared picture of the heliosphere. To compose a synthetic intensity map of the interstellar dust thermal emission, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the distribution of the dust particles inside the heliosphere. We considered the effects of the heliosphere boundaries and the non-stationary current sheet. The change in the Parker magnetic field caused by the solar activity cycle leads distinguishable features in the mid-infrared emission maps of the heliosphere. The distribution of the interstellar dust in the vicinity of the Sun we calculated suggests that small particles linger outside of the heliosphere, and medium-size particles are mostly affected by the changing interplanetary magnetic field, which leads to number density waves in the tail region of the heliosphere. Finally, large particles form a bulge behind the Sun."}

A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries.

Multiple Spiral Mode Formation via Swing Amplification", "comment": "20 pages, 12 figures, Submitted to A&A", "summary": "We investigate the formation of multiple spiral modes in Milky Way-like disk-halo systems without explicitly exciting perturbations. We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\\star=5\\times10^6$, $N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star \\le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^6$ and $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small."}

Neptune-sized exoplanets or exo-Neptunes are fundamental in the description of exoplanet diversity. Their evolution is sculpted by atmospheric escape, often traced by absorption in the H i Lyman-α line at 1,216 Å and the He i triplet line at 1.08 μm. On warm exo-Neptunes HAT-P-11 b, GJ 3470 b and GJ 436 b, H i Lyman-α absorption causes extreme in-transit obscuration of their host stars. This suggests that He i triplet line absorption will also be strong, yet it has only been identified on two of these planets. Aims. We explore previously unaccounted for processes that might attenuate the He i triplet line on warm exo-Neptunes. In particular, we assess the role of vibrationally excited H2 to remove the He+ ion that acts as precursor of the absorbing He(2$^3$S ). Methods. We formed thermal rate coefficients for this chemical process, leveraging the available theoretical and experimental data. The process becomes notably fast at the temperatures expected in the atmospheric layers probed by the He i triplet line. Results. Our simulations show that the proposed process severely mutes the line on GJ 3470 b and causes the nondetection on GJ 436 b. The overall efficiency of this mechanism is connected to where in the atmosphere the H2-to-H transition occurs and, ultimately, to the amount of high-energy radiation received by the planet. The process will be more significant on small exoplanets than on hotter or more massive ones, as for the latter the H2-to-H transition generally occurs deeper in the atmosphere. Conclusions. Weak He i triplet line absorption need not imply the lack of a primordial, H2-He-dominated atmosphere, an idea to bear in mind when interpreting the observations of other small exoplanets."}

However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation."}

Appendix. Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics; further comments and questions welcome", "summary": "High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \\texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $β$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \\texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns."}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study focused on the retrieval of intrinsic pulsar profiles through the utilization of a CLEAN-based algorithm as described in Bhat et al. (2003). The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the capabilities of our pipeline in the context of recovering the intrinsic profiles and associated parameters, such as dispersion measure, frequency scaling index, scattering time, pulse broadening function, and time of arrival residuals. We use simulated profiles to rigorously test and validate the efficiency of our recovery pipeline. These simulated profiles encompass single and multi-component Gaussians, designed to emulate the diverse nature of pulsar profiles. By comparing the recovered profiles and parameters to their injected values, as derived from simulations, we provide a robust evaluation of the pipeline's performance along with its drawbacks and limitations."}

We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs. Future cosmological zoom-in simulations, with better resolution in the CGM, will be essential to resolve turbulent mixing layers and feedback-inflow interactions that determine whether cold streams can reach the galactic disk."}

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date."}

We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets."}

While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models."}

LRD sample and measurements are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17665942", "summary": "We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0μ$m, with typical T~5000K or $λ_{peak}$~$0.65μ$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $λ_{peak}<0.65μ$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $β_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $Hα,\\ Hβ$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$α$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$α$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{Hα}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments."}

Host-galaxy association is crucial for selecting the most scientifically interesting transients for follow-up. LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data."}

To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

The early-time light curves of SN 2021ukt exhibit a ~25 day plateau. Such a short phase of hydrogen recombination suggests a rather thin H-rich outer envelope of the progenitor star. The relatively narrow Balmer emission lines in spectra of SN 2021ukt during the first week indicate the interaction between the expanding ejecta and the immediate circumstellar material (CSM). This Hα line is observed throughout its helium-rich ejecta-dominated phase and nebular phase, suggesting persistent interaction with a radially extended CSM profile. We explore the synthetic light-curve model among grids of parameters generated by MESA+STELLA. We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] λλ 7291, 7324 and [O I] λλ 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses. This study adds to the growing sample of transitional supernovae, reinforcing evidence for a continuum of underrepresented progenitors whose evolutionary pathways lie between those of standard SN models."}

These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star."}

We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \\sim 1-10~M_\\odot$ and $R \\lesssim 10~\\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\\mathrm{DM}} \\le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$ and radii $R<10^{6}~\\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects."}

The suite contains 65 haloes selected from Local Group like environments, spanning $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}=10^7$ to $5\\times10^9\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. The sample includes small ultra-faints with $M_\\ast\\sim100\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ through to classical dwarfs with $M_\\ast \\sim 5\\times10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, as well as haloes that remain dark to the present day. We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^5$-$10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^7 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^8 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^9 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\\ast\\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ or remain dark.

All three components of the system are O- or B-type stars. We carried out a comprehensive study of the system, based on light curves from TESS and other instruments, a new series of echelle spectra, older spectra from the ESO archive, and several VLTI interferometric observations. Due to the large amount of different types of data covering both orbits in the system, we obtained a more precise value of the long orbital period ($1603.24\\pm0.19$ d) and fully determined all other orbital parameters. Although both orbits are eccentric, their period ratio is large enough for the system to be dynamically stable. The inner and outer orbits are in the same plane, which means that no Kozai-Lidov mechanism is acting in the system. Assuming solar metallicity in our MESA models, we found ages of $(4.4\\pm 0.1)$, $(4.7\\pm 0.2)$, and $(3.8\\pm1.3)$ Myr for the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary, respectively. Our evolutionary scenario predicts that the inner eclipsing binary will merge within approximately 1.7 Myr and eventually evolve into a black hole. The distance to the system, estimated from the angular size of the outer orbit is $(809.9 \\pm 1.8)$ pc, which implies that $δ$ Cir might be located close to the centre of a stellar population ASCC 79, a subgroup of the young Circinus complex.

However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation."}

These mapping observations were performed with two frequency settings providing 10 GHz in total (131.4-133.9 GHz and 145.1-147.6 GHz; 136.2-138.7 GHz and 149.9-152.4 GHz) with a frequency resolution of 76.293 kHz. We conducted spectral line identification analysis for the hot core and compact ridge regions in the Orion-KL with a beam size of 11-12$''$. We detected nearly 400 emission lines and identified two recombination lines and 29 molecular species, including isotopologues, deuterated molecules, and vibrational excited states, despite the short integration time. These results are consistent with those of previous studies. The 29 molecular species include nitrogen (N)-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs) and oxygen (O)-bearing COMs. To demonstrate the capability of the B4R in astrochemistry, we conducted detailed analyses of column densities, rotational temperatures, and relative abundances with respect to H$_2$ on two representative COMs, N-bearing C$_2$H$_5$CN and O-bearing CH$_3$OCHO in the central 40$''\\times$40$''$ area of the map. The wide bandwidth of 10 GHz enabled the use of 8 and 34 emission lines, respectively.

One peculiar feature is that the lighter $s$-process elements (e.g., Zr and Mo) present larger anomalies than the heavier $s$-process elements (e.g., Nd and W). To address this observation, we compared Zr and Nd data to model predictions of the s-process abundances at the surface of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of initial metallicity from solar to twice solar. We found that the relative magnitude of the isotopic variability between these two elements can be matched by models of AGB stars of super-solar metallicity. The match is favoured by stronger convective overshoot, leading to a deeper dredge-up of the H-rich envelope into the He-rich region, and/or a smaller (~ half than standard) mass of the region rich in the $^{13}$C nuclei that produce free neutrons via the $^{13}$C($α$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. We conclude that nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can match the difference in the magnitude of the bulk meteoritic variations in Zr and Nd, provided that super-solar metallicity stars are the original site of these signatures. The AGB stars that produced such variations could have belonged to the current population of old, super-solar metallicity stars seen in the galactic solar neighbourhood."}

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date."}

Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 < 0.01$ and $< 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\\sim 10^6\\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision."}

Dust temperatures ($T_{d}$) are determined based on the corresponding galaxy dust masses, independently calculated in our previous work, through a self-consistent method, without the need to actually perform a complete spectral energy distribution (SED) fit of the cold dust emission fluxes. The range and average dust temperatures are found to be consistent within errors with values from other studies. Simultaneously, the dust emissivity indices ($β_{d}$) are determined, and their evolution with temperature quantified, with the $T_{d}$ anti-correlation still being present. It is investigated whether $β_{d}$ can be predicted from other relation or if it scales with other integrated dust / ISM or galaxy property, which could be used as a proxy. In this respect, new and established relations between $T_{d}$, $β_{d}$, the dust surface density and global / integrated galaxy and star-formation related quantities are presented and analysed. We find that SFR, sSFR or $Σ_{SFR}$ are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one.

Six datasets were processed from which three are presented, all of which have been analyzed and validated through comparison using the open-source software Gammapy and the MAGIC analysis software MARS.\n  Furthermore, looking towards a large-scale production of standardized data and a legacy of the data taken by the MAGIC experiment, we have developed and implemented the automated database-driven MAGIC data reduction tool autoMAGIC which offers a reliable and reproducible way to produce high-level datasets. By utilizing the automatization of parameter configuration choices, the software allows for a reduction of human error as well as an acceleration in the production of standardized data. Here, we also show comparable results for data processed with manual and automatic methods."}

There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($ψ$ between 5 and 20$^{\\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5σ$ from the expected radius from stellar models."}

A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead."}

This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $τ$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models."}

We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate populations of CCSNe across a wide range of metallicities and binary evolution assumptions. Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes. Our DTDs show that models reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate produce a larger fraction of late CCSNe than is expected under standard assumptions."}

These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo."}

Previous studies have questioned, using Gaia DR2 data, whether HV 11417 was truly located at the distance of the SMC or was instead a foreground star. However, the proper motion measurement uncertainties for HV 11417 in DR2 were high. In this work, we use Gaia DR3 data to show that HV 11417 is very likely to be a true member of the SMC. We further analyze the kinematics of HV 11417 relative to its local environment, and compare it to populations of massive and evolved stars in the SMC. We find HV 11417 has a local transverse velocity of $52\\pm15$ km/s, and thus qualifies as a runaway star (v$_\\mathrm{loc}\\geq$ 30 km/s). This runaway classification does not conclusively prove its nature as a TŻO, particularly given results from recent TŻO models, but does indicate that HV 11417 experienced a kinematic disruption in its evolution."}

It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above."}

There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($ψ$ between 5 and 20$^{\\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5σ$ from the expected radius from stellar models."}

Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns."}

Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers."}

While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $ρ= 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\\sim$297 AU, $\\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations."}

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date."}

These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead."}

In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Brγ emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage.

We apply the data-driven approach proposed by Posti (2022) to include the characteristic amplitude and scale length of such correlations as `nuisance parameters'. We construct mass models for $134$ galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve compilation with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and pseudo-isothermal sphere (pISO) models for the dark halo. Allowing for correlations in the rotation curves generally improves the goodness of fit for both halo models, often yielding a formally good fit ($χ^2_\\mathrm{r}\\approx 1$) and model uncertainties that seem more representative of the constraining power of the data. For both halo models the inference on the typical correlation amplitude and scale length are very similar and physically plausible, $\\sim 20\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, respectively. The parametric form that we use to describe the correlations is intentionally simple, and our fitting approach makes the parameters describing possible correlations prone to `absorbing' other systematic errors, so we regard these estimates as upper limits. Without allowing for correlations we find a statistical preference for the pISO over the NFW model for $88$/$134$ galaxies; this preference essentially disappears when correlations are allowed for. Accounting for correlations in rotation curves when constructing mass models fundamentally affects how they are interpreted, highlighting an important systematic uncertainty that affects evidence for cusps or cores in dark matter haloes."}

One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Brγ emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature."}

As another abundant S-bearing molecules, SO and its isotopomer $^{34}$SO could be considered as tracers of the $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratio. We present the first systematic observations of SO and $^{34}$SO toward a large sample of molecular clouds with accurate distances, performed with the IRAM 30 m and the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the IRAM 30 m, SO $2_2-1_1$ was detected in 59 of 82 sources ($\\sim$82%), and $^{34}$SO $2_2-1_1$ in 8 sources ($\\sim$10%). With the SMT 10 m, SO $5_5-4_4$ was detected in 136 of 184 sources ($\\sim$74%), and $^{34}$SO $5_5-4_4$ in 55 of 77 strong SO sources ($\\sim$72%). SO/$^{34}$SO ratios were derived for 8 ($2_2-1_1$) and 55 ($5_5-4_4$) sources. No correlation was found between the SO/$^{34}$SO ratio and heliocentric distance or $T_k$, suggesting negligible distance and fractionation effects. Both LTE and non-LTE analyses consistently suggest that the optical depth effect is also insignificant. $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from the $2_2-1_1$ transitions follow the increasing radial trend proposed by previous CS species measurements, while those from the $5_5-4_4$ lines are systematically lower. The lower transitions of SO and $^{34}$SO may be suitable tracers of $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S, though the detections are rare. Comparisons between measurements and Galactic chemical evolution model suggest that the nucleosynthesis prescriptions need to be revised in the low-metallicity regime, but more data for the outermost Galactic regions are crucial for drawing strong conclusions."}

We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets."}

We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z\\sim10$) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies ($>0.1$) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency ($\\sim20\\%$), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars."}

In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc."}

We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $Δm_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3σ$) between $Δm_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3σ$) between Si II PVF velocity and $Δm_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations."}

Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies.

Our FAST observed targets are combined with other AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies covered in the ALFALFA footprint to form a more comprehensive sample. Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe."}

Traditional methods for identifying bars are often labor-intensive and subjective, limiting their scalability for large astronomical surveys. To address this, a synthetic dataset of 1,000 barred spiral galaxy images was generated, incorporating realistic components such as disks, bars, bulges, spiral arms, stars, and observational noise, modeled through Gaussian, Ferrers, and Sersic functions. The YOLO-OBB model, trained on this dataset for six epochs, achieved robust validation metrics, including a precision of 0.93745, recall of 0.85, and mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.94173. Applied to 10 real galaxy images, the model extracted physical parameters, such as bar lengths ranging from 2.27 to 9.70 kpc and orientations from 13.41$^\\circ$ to 134.11$^\\circ$, with detection confidences between 0.26 and 0.68. These measurements, validated through pixel-to-kiloparsec conversions, align with established bar sizes, demonstrating the model's reliability. The methodology's scalability and interpretability enable efficient analysis of complex galaxy morphologies, particularly for dwarf galaxies and varied orientations. Future research aims to expand the dataset to 5,000 galaxies and integrate the Tremaine-Weinberg method to measure bar pattern speeds, enhancing insights into galaxy dynamics and evolution.

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data."}

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $μ$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT."}

In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead."}

Yet, a comprehensive and systematic catalog of mid-infrared variable sources has remained unavailable. In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale."}

Characterizing Sensitivity to Companions at Sub-Diffraction Limit Separations with HST WFC3/IR", "comment": "Accepted by AJ 14 November 2025, 16 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "We characterize the sensitivity of a double point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm -- employing empirical, position-dependent PSF models -- for detecting companions using the infrared channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date."}

These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo."}
