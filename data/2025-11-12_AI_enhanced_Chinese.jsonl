This stellar class is also the most frequent host of molecular gas in systems older than typical protoplanetary disc lifetimes, and the most likely to host detected giant planets in radial-velocity surveys. The debris discs of intermediate-mass stars have therefore become fertile ground for studying disc-planet interactions. In this work, we present the first ALMA observations toward the A-type star HD 126062, located in Upper Centaurus Lupus / Lower Centaurus Crux, with the aim of characterising its debris disc. We probed the thermal continuum emission using observations at 1.3 mm, analysed through image reconstruction under different visibility-weighting regimes and parametric model fitting to the observed visibilities. The setup also covered the frequency of the 12CO(2-1) line, allowing imaging of gas near the system. We detected dust continuum emission from an exo-Kuiper belt around HD 126062. Modelled as a Gaussian ring, the visibilities are consistent with a radial separation R = 2.01'' (+0.04, -0.05), equivalent to ~270 (+5, -4) au, and a full width at half maximum DeltaR = 0.71'' +- 0.09 (95 +- 12 au). The continuum emission appears nearly face-on, with inclination <=17 deg. 12CO(2-1) emission is detected in the vicinity of the debris disc, with most of it located external to the exo-Kuiper belt. The exo-Kuiper belt characterised here is among the largest yet detected and agrees with previous predictions of the dust distribution based on spectral energy distribution fitting. The morphology and velocity offset relative to the systemic velocity suggest that the gas is not associated with the star or disc, but likely originates from a diffuse cloud in the nearby galaxy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528ALMA\u89c2\u6d4bA\u578b\u6052\u661fHD 126062\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5176\u5916\u67ef\u4f0a\u4f2f\u5e26\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u5916\u90e8CO\u6c14\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u5916\u67ef\u4f0a\u4f2f\u5e26\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u5916\u90e8\u6c14\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4e91\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f(1-3 Msun)\u62e5\u6709\u6700\u4eae\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u5145\u5206\u7684\u788e\u7247\u76d8\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5178\u578b\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5bff\u547d\u540e\u6700\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u6052\u661f\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u76d8-\u884c\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ALMA\u57281.3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u70ed\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8986\u76d612CO(2-1)\u8c31\u7ebf\u9891\u7387\u4ee5\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u9644\u8fd1\u6c14\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230HD 126062\u5916\u67ef\u4f0a\u4f2f\u5e26\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u73af\uff0c\u5f84\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6270 au\uff0c\u534a\u9ad8\u5168\u5bbd\u7ea695 au\uff0c\u503e\u89d2<=17\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u9644\u8fd1\u63a2\u6d4b\u523012CO(2-1)\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5916\u67ef\u4f0a\u4f2f\u5e26\u5916\u90e8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5916\u67ef\u4f0a\u4f2f\u5e26\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6c14\u4f53\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0d\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u6216\u76d8\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4e91\u3002"}}

Consequently, accretion in eccentric close binaries is highly variable and synchronized with their orbits, producing bursts near periastron passages. In this study, we examine the orbital and accretion properties of the eccentric Classical T-Tauri binary DQ Tau using medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooter and UVES instruments. The data were taken during a monitoring of inner disk chemistry with JWST, and our analysis is needed for correct interpretation of JWST data. We refine the orbital parameters and report an increment in the argument of periastron of 30 degrees. This apsidal motion may be caused by the massive disk acting as a third body. We also explore the possibility that it is due to a still undetected additional (sub-)stellar companion, estimating a lower limit of 15 MJ for its mass at the cavity edge (a=3 abin). We investigate accretion of the primary and secondary using the Ca II 849.8 nm emission line. The primary accretes more at periastron than in previous quiescent phases, while the secondary dominates post-periastron. Additionally, we report elevated Lacc at apastron, possibly due to interaction with irregularly shaped structures near the closest approach to the circumbinary disk. Finally, we derive each star's accretion luminosity across disentangled epochs and compare it to UV-excess-based results, finding good agreement. The individual Lacc values can be used as input for chemical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7VLT X-Shooter\u548cUVES\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u7ecf\u5178T-Tauri\u53cc\u661fDQ Tau\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8630\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd1\u661f\u70b9\u8fdb\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e3b\u661f\u548c\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u91caJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLT X-Shooter\u548cUVES\u4eea\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u548cCa II 849.8 nm\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8630\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd1\u661f\u70b9\u8fdb\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u76d8\u6216\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u5f15\u8d77\uff1b\u4e3b\u661f\u5728\u8fd1\u661f\u70b9\u5438\u79ef\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f34\u661f\u5728\u8fd1\u661f\u70b9\u540e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5438\u79ef\uff1b\u5728\u8fdc\u661f\u70b9\u4e5f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5438\u79ef\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "DQ Tau\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u5149\u5ea6\u503c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5438\u79ef\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, these atmospheres may also be polluted via solid accretion or ice sublimation in the disk. Here, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the atmospheres of these giant planets with volatiles via pebble drift, fragmentation, and ice sublimation. We use a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer, and particle tracking to follow the trajectories and resulting temperatures of solids in a disk containing an embedded planet forming outside the CO snowline. We show that small dust can become entrained in the meridional flows created by the giant planet and advected above the disk midplane where temperatures are well above the sublimation temperature of CO. This transport of small grains occurs over 10 kyr timescales, with individual micron-sized grains cycling between the midplane and surface of the disk multiple times throughout the planetary accretion stage. We find that this stirring of dust results in sublimation of CO gas above the snow surface in the dust trap created exterior to the giant planet, leading to super-solar CO abundances in the pressure bump. This mechanism of Dust Recycling and Icy Volatile Enrichment in cold giant planets, which we call the DRIVE effect, may explain enhanced metallicities of both wide separation exoplanets as well as Jupiter in our own Solar System.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5375\u77f3\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u7834\u788e\u548c\u51b0\u5347\u534e\u6765\u5bcc\u96c6\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u4e2d\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014DRIVE\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u548c\u6728\u661f\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u592a\u9633\u4e30\u5ea6CO\u5bcc\u96c6\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u6c14\u76f8\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u6216\u51b0\u5347\u534e\u800c\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u592a\u9633\u4e30\u5ea6\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u5bcc\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u54083D\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5d4c\u5165\u5728CO\u96ea\u7ebf\u5916\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4e2d\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u88ab\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ecf\u5411\u6d41\u643a\u5e26\u5230\u76d8\u9762\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e8eCO\u5347\u534e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5faa\u73af\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u884c\u661f\u5916\u90e8\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u9677\u9631\u4e2dCO\u6c14\u4f53\u5347\u534e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8d85\u592a\u9633\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684CO\u5bcc\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "DRIVE\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5c18\u57c3\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u51b0\u51b7\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u5bcc\u96c6\uff09\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u51b7\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5bbd\u5206\u79bb\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u548c\u6728\u661f\uff09\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\u03b1$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\u03b1$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr.

Rapid rotation in massive stars leads to gravity darkening and oblateness, significantly affecting their radiation-driven winds. These effects can alter wind dynamics and play a role in forming slowly equatorial outflowing winds. Aims. This work investigates the transition region where the fast solution (i.e. high terminal velocities) of radiation-driven winds in a massive rotating star, in the frame of the modified-CAK theory, switches to the Omega-slow solutions (a denser and slower wind) when the effects of gravity darkening and oblateness are considered. This Omega-slow solution appears when the rotational speed is higher and equal to 75% of the critical rotation speed. Methods. To explore the transition region for various equatorial models of B-type stars, we focus on the co-existence interval where both solutions simultaneously exist and the transition point where fast solutions switch to Omega-slow solutions. Results. Using our stationary numerical code Hydwind, we first analyse the individual effects of gravity darkening and stellar oblateness caused by high rotational speeds and then examine their combined impact on the wind solutions. Conclusions. We find that for a certain range of rotational speeds, both the fast and Omega-slow solutions can co-exist, and the co-existence range strongly depends on the initial conditions. When only gravity darkening is considered, the co-existing interval shifts towards higher rotational speeds. While in the presence of the oblateness, the co-existing interval also occurs at higher rotational speeds; however, it is less than the gravity darkening effect. We also explored how line-force parameters affect the critical point, the location of the co-existing interval, and where the solution switches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u661f\u98ce\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u529b\u53d8\u6697\u548c\u6241\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5feb\u901f\u89e3\u5411Omega\u6162\u89e3\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u53d8\u6697\u548c\u6052\u661f\u6241\u7387\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u661f\u98ce\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u8d64\u9053\u6d41\u51fa\u98ce\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hydwind\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790B\u578b\u6052\u661f\u8d64\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u529b\u53d8\u6697\u548c\u6241\u7387\u7684\u5355\u72ec\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u89e3\u5171\u5b58\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8f6c\u901f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u89e3\u548cOmega\u6162\u89e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u5171\u5b58\u8303\u56f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u91cd\u529b\u53d8\u6697\u4f7f\u5171\u5b58\u533a\u95f4\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u8f6c\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6241\u7387\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f46\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u529b\u53d8\u6697\u548c\u6241\u7387\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u8f90\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u661f\u98ce\u7684\u89e3\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5171\u5b58\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ebf\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

By applying mipmapping (local recursive spatial averaging) and sparse voxel grids, we exploit spatial coherence and sparsity in astrophysical models to accelerate the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called \"Core and Voigt\". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 % error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations.

We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 < [\\mathrm{Fe/H}] \\leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days.

The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement.

How the variability of the stellar cycle changes with the rotation rate or the dynamo number is a valuable information for understanding the stellar dynamo process. We examine the variability in the stellar magnetic cycles by studying 81 stars from the data of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which started observations in 1966. For 28 stars, we have time series data available till 2003, while for others, the data are limited till 1995. We specifically explore how the variability changes with respect to three rotation-related parameters. We find a modest positive correlation between the variability and the stellar rotation period. In addition, we find suggestive negative correlations between the variability and the inverse squared Rossby number ($Ro^{-2}$), and the ratio of the mean cycle duration and rotation period ($\\log \\, (\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle / P_{\\rm rot})^2$). Variability computed from the magnetic field of stellar dynamo models also show similar trends. Finally, inspired by previous studies, we examine dynamo number scaling in our model data and find that $Ro^{-0.6}$ (instead of $Ro^{-2}$ as suggested in the linear $\u03b1\u03a9$ dynamo theory) and $(\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle /P_{\\rm rot})^{0.6}$ (instead of $\\log \\, (\\langle P_{\\rm cyc} \\rangle / P_{\\rm rot})^2$ as predicted in previous observations) are a good measure of the dynamo number.

We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $\u03ba\\propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $\u03ba_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u5316\u7684\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u968f\u538b\u529b\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b49\u6e29\u9759\u6c34\u5927\u6c14\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u900f\u5c04\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7b49\u538b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62df\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b49\u6e29\u7b49\u538b\u900f\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u7b49\u538b\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u5c06\u5782\u76f4\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u660e\u786e\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u968f\u538b\u529b\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u03ba\u221dP^n\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u538b\u529bP0\u5904\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u53c2\u8003\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u03ba0\uff0c\u5c06\u503e\u659c\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u5f84\u5411\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b49\u6e29\u9759\u6c34\u5927\u6c14\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u900f\u5c04\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7403\u548c\u70ed\u6728\u661fWASP-39b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b49\u538b\u516c\u5f0f\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u62df\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790JWST\u548c\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684ARIEL\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u534a\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u670d\u52a1\u4e8eJWST\u548cARIEL\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

By adding a rotating disk component to the biconical outflow model of Bae & Woo, we find that models with a rotating disk require faster launching velocities ($\\lesssim$ 1500 km s$^{-1}$) than outflow-only models to be consistent with the observed gas kinematics of local type 2 AGNs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed distribution of gas kinematics of a large sample ($\\sim$ 39,000), constraining the launching velocity and opening angle. While the launching velocity is moderate for the majority of the local AGNs, the notable cases of 2 - 5 % show strong outflows with $V_{max} \\sim 1000-1500$ km s$^{-1}$. By examining the seeing effect based on the mock integral field unit data, we find that the outflow sizes measured based on velocity widths tend to be overestimated when the angular size of the outflow is comparable to or smaller than the seeing. This result highlights the need for more careful treatments of the seeing effect in the outflow size measurement, yet it still supports the lack of global feedback by gas outflows for local AGNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6d41\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u6d41\u51fa\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8AGNs\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u7403\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u9525\u6d41\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7535\u79bb\u6d41\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Bae & Woo\u7684\u53cc\u9525\u6d41\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u73b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f00\u53e3\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u22641500 km/s\uff09\uff0c2-5%\u7684AGNs\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u6d41\u51fa\uff08V_max ~ 1000-1500 km/s\uff09\u3002\u5f53\u6d41\u51fa\u89d2\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u89c6\u5b81\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u6d41\u51fa\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f1a\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u6d41\u51fa\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5730\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u5b81\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8AGNs\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6c14\u4f53\u6d41\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u7403\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Submitted to ApJL", "summary": "Recent discoveries have revealed a population of \"popcorn planets\" that have masses similar to that of Neptune but radii comparable to Jupiter, leading to exceptionally low bulk densities $\u03c1_p \\lesssim 0.3\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Their anomalously-inflated radii, along with recent JWST atmospheric observations, suggest a source of internal heating. Because these planets are nominally too cool to be affected by the hot Jupiter inflation mechanism, dissipation of eccentricity tides within the planet has been proposed as a leading explanation for the source of this heat flux. Using the MAROON-X spectrograph on Gemini-North, we conducted a high-precision radial-velocity campaign to precisely measure the eccentricities of three of these popcorn planets: WASP-107 b, TOI-1173 b, and HAT-P-18 b. We constrained their eccentricities below $e < 0.03$--$0.05$ to 95% confidence, decisively ruling out active heating from eccentricity tides as the cause of these planets' inflated radii (except for the unlikely scenario in which their tidal quality factors are less than the Earth's). An alternative heating mechanism is likely responsible for inflating these planets. Our measurements also provide new constraints on $e\\cos\u03c9$, significantly shrinking the eclipse timing uncertainties to better than $\\pm2.5$ hr and allowing for confident scheduling of thermal emission measurements for these enigmatic planets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u6f6e\u6c50\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u7206\u7c73\u82b1\u884c\u661f\"\u534a\u5f84\u5f02\u5e38\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u70ed\u6e90\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u661f\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u90fd\u4f4e\u4e8e0.03-0.05\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a0\u70ed\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u661f\u7684\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\"\u7206\u7c73\u82b1\u884c\u661f\"\uff08\u8d28\u91cf\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u4f46\u534a\u5f84\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6728\u661f\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\uff09\u534a\u5f84\u5f02\u5e38\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u504f\u5fc3\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u662f\u5426\u662f\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u70ed\u6e90\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gemini-North\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4e0a\u7684MAROON-X\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cfWASP-107 b\u3001TOI-1173 b\u548cHAT-P-18 b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7206\u7c73\u82b1\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4ee595%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u9650\u5236\u5728e < 0.03-0.05\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534a\u5f84\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff08\u9664\u975e\u5176\u6f6e\u6c50\u54c1\u8d28\u56e0\u5b50\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5730\u7403\u7684\u6781\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u5fc3\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u4e0d\u662f\u7206\u7c73\u82b1\u884c\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a0\u70ed\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u98df\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u70ed\u53d1\u5c04\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Chibueze"], "title": "Investigating star formation scenarios in the Milky Way using YSO distributions - A pilot study", "comment": "Pages: 18 Figures 14 Tables: 3", "summary": "We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%).

In this paper we fit the stellar spectral energy distributions of exoplanet hosts to measure their radii, making use of only archival photometry, the $Gaia$ parallaxes and $Gaia$ extinction maps. Using the extinction maps frees us of the degeneracy between temperature and extinction which has plagued this method in the past. The resulting radii have typical random uncertainties of about 2 per cent. We perform a quantitative study of systematic uncertainties affecting the methodology and find they are similar to, or smaller than, the random ones. We discuss how the stellar parameters can be used to derive the properties of both transiting exoplanets, and those where only a radial-velocity curve is available. We then explore in detail the improvements the method makes possible for the parameters of the PanCET sample of transiting planets. For this sample we find the best literature measurements of the planetary radii have mean uncertainties about 40 per cent larger than those presented here, with the new measurements achieving precisions of 2 per cent in radius and 10 per cent in mass. In contrast to much recent work, these transiting exoplanets parameters are derived without using theoretical models of stellar interiors, freeing them of the assumptions those models contain, and any priors for stellar age. As the data used are available for the whole sky, the method can be used for self-consistent measurements of the planetary parameters of a very large fraction of known exoplanets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528Gaia\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6863\u6848\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6052\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6052\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6052\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6052\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u53d7\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6d88\u5149\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u56f0\u6270\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\u6052\u661f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6863\u6848\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\u3001Gaia\u89c6\u5dee\u548cGaia\u6d88\u5149\u56fe\u62df\u5408\u6052\u661f\u5149\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u3002\u6d88\u5149\u56fe\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6d88\u5149\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6052\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5178\u578b\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a2%\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002\u5bf9PanCET\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u884c\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u52302%\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523010%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6587\u732e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea640%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5e74\u9f84\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u5929\u7a7a\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002"}}

Investigating the origins of iron-rich planetesimals could provide key insights into planet formation mechanisms. Using differentiation models, we evaluate the interior structure and composition of representative-sized planetesimals (approx. 200 km diameter) while varying oxygen fugacity and initial bulk meteoritic composition. Under the oxygen-poor conditions that likely existed early in the inner regions of the Solar System and other protoplanetary disks, core fractions remain relatively consistent across a range of bulk compositions (CI, H, EH, and CBa). Some of these cores could incorporate significant amounts of silicon (10-30 wt percent) and explain the metal fractions of Fe-rich bodies in the absence of mantle stripping. Conversely, planetesimals forming under more oxidizing conditions, such as beyond snow lines, could exhibit smaller cores enriched in carbon, sulfur (more than 1 wt percent), and oxides. Sulfur-rich cores, like those formed from EH and H bulk compositions, could remain partly molten, sustain dynamos, and even drive sulfur-rich volcanism. Additionally, bodies with high carbon contents, such as CI compositions, can form graphitic outer layers. These variations highlight the importance of initial formation conditions in shaping planetesimal structures. Future missions, such as NASA's Psyche mission, offer an opportunity to measure the relative abundances of key elements (Fe, Ni, Si, and S) necessary to distinguish among formation scenarios and structure models for Fe-rich and reduced planetesimals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6c27\u9038\u5ea6\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u5206\u4e0b\u7ea6200\u516c\u91cc\u76f4\u5f84\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u8d2b\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u7845\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u6c27\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6838\u5fc3\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f46\u5bcc\u542b\u78b3\u3001\u786b\u548c\u6c27\u5316\u7269\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u661f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bcc\u94c1\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u53ef\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6c27\u9038\u5ea6\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u5206\u4e0b\u7684\u661f\u5b50\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5206\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5927\u5c0f\u661f\u5b50\uff08\u7ea6200\u516c\u91cc\u76f4\u5f84\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u6c27\u9038\u5ea6\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u9668\u77f3\u6210\u5206\uff08CI\u3001H\u3001EH\u3001CBa\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8d2b\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6838\u5fc3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u542b10-30%\u7845\uff0c\u6c27\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6838\u5fc3\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f46\u5bcc\u542b\u78b3\u3001\u786b\uff08>1%\uff09\u548c\u6c27\u5316\u7269\uff0c\u786b\u4e30\u5bcc\u6838\u5fc3\u53ef\u7ef4\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u7194\u878d\u548c\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u661f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u6765Psyche\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6765\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u60c5\u666f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time.

Hera is a planetary defence mission that aims to provide a detailed characterization of the near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos-Dimorphos after the NASA/DART mission impact. HS-H is a versatile dual-use payload, functioning as a hyperspectral imager that captures both images and spectral data within the 0.65--0.95 $\u03bc$m wavelength range. The observations from this instrument will offer key insights regarding the composition of the two bodies Didymos and Dimorphos, space weathering effects, and the potential presence of exogenous material on these asteroids. Thanks to its wide field of view ($\\approx 15.5^\\circ \\times 8.3^\\circ$ in paraxial approximation), HS-H will be able to monitor the system's orbital dynamic and dust environment. At the same time, both components of this binary asteroid remain in the field of view for most of the asteroid phase of the mission. These results also complement the data obtained from other instruments in characterizing the geomorphological units. The data that will be obtained by HS-H will enable the creation of maps highlighting key spectral features, such as taxonomic classification, spectral slope, and band parameters. This article presents the pre-flight calibration of the instrument, outlines the science objectives, and discusses the expected investigations.

Massive stars found in the field are often considered to be runaways from star clusters or OB associations. However, there is evidence in the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud of high-mass stars that appear isolated in the field and cannot be related to any known star cluster or OB association. Studies of more distant galaxies have been lacking so far. $\\textit{Aims.}$ In this work, we identified massive star candidates that appear isolated in the field of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4242 (distance: 5.3 Mpc), to explore how many candidates for isolated star formation we find in a galaxy outside the Local Group. $\\textit{Methods.}$ We identified 234 massive ($M_{ini}\\geq15M_{\\odot}$) and young ($\\leq 10$ Myr) field stars in NGC 4242 using the Hubble Space Telescope's Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the UVIS channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 from the Galaxy UV Legacy Project (GULP) and optical data from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We investigated the surroundings of our targets within the range of projected distances expected for runaway stars, $74$ pc and $204$ pc. $\\textit{Results.}$ We find that between $9.8\\%$ and $34.6\\%$ of our targets have no young stellar groups or massive stars within the threshold radii, making them appear isolated. This fraction reduces to $3.2\\%-11.5\\%$ when we consider the total number of massive stars expected from the observed UV star formation rate. $\\textit{Conclusions.}$ Our results show that there is a small population of young and massive, potentially isolated field stars in NGC 4242.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728NGC 4242\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa234\u9897\u5e74\u8f7b\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e2d3.2%-11.5%\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5171\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5728\u661f\u56e2\u6216OB\u661f\u534f\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728NGC 4242\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e74\u8f7b\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u661f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5468\u56f474-204 pc\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6052\u661f\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b09.8%-34.6%\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u661f\u5728\u9608\u503c\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u6ca1\u6709\u5e74\u8f7b\u661f\u7fa4\u6216\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u5f53\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bd4\u4f8b\u964d\u81f33.2%-11.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "NGC 4242\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5c0f\u7fa4\u5e74\u8f7b\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u5b64\u7acb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u573a\u661f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5b64\u7acb\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Brightness asymmetries (e.g. starspots) rotating in and out of view can also cause apparent motion of the photocenter, termed astrometric jitter, that has previously been considered a source of noise. Here, we explore whether it can be used to map stellar surfaces. We derive a Cramer-Rao bound on the minimum variance for which a stellar surface can theoretically be estimated, quantifying the information content in rotational astrometric jitter. To regularize and break singularities in the Fisher information, we impose a spatial-smoothness Gaussian-Markov random field prior. A key challenge in mapping surfaces arises for stars with unknown rotational axis inclinations, requiring joint estimation of the inclination and the stellar surface.

We constrain the spatial distribution and mineralogy of dust in the RY Tau protoplanetary disk in the inner few astronomical units using spectrally resolved interferometric observations in the L, M, and N bands obtained with VLTI/MATISSE.\n  Employing a 2D temperature gradient model we estimate the orientation of the inner disk finding no evidence of significant misalignment between the inner and outer disk of RY Tau. Successively, we analyze the chemical composition of silicates depending on spatial region in the disk and identify several silicate species commonly found in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, a depletion of amorphous dust grains toward the central protostar is observed. Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band. However, the closure phases in the N band are underestimated by our model, hinting at an additional asymmetry in the flux density distribution not visible at shorter wavelengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528VLTI/MATISSE\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4bRY Tau\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5185\u76d8\u5c18\u57c3\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u77ff\u7269\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u76d8\u4e0e\u5916\u76d8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5411\u4e2d\u592e\u539f\u6052\u661f\u65b9\u5411\u975e\u6676\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RY Tau\u8fc7\u6e21\u76d8\u5185\u51e0AU\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u77ff\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLTI/MATISSE\u5728L\u3001M\u548cN\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u5e72\u6d89\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u75282D\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u76d8\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u76d8\u4e0e\u5916\u76d8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u7845\u9178\u76d0\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5411\u4e2d\u592e\u539f\u6052\u661f\u65b9\u5411\u975e\u6676\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u51cf\u5c11\uff0cN\u6ce2\u6bb5\u95ed\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9760\u8fd1\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u70bd\u70ed\u5c18\u57c3\u548c\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5185\u76d8\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e73\u9762\u6295\u5c04\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86L\u548cM\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9NWA 7721\u9668\u77f3\u4e2d\u6a44\u6984\u77f3\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e9a\u6676\u7c92\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u7ec6\u5c0f\u7684\u65e0\u5e94\u53d8\u518d\u7ed3\u6676\u4e9a\u6676\u7c92\u548c\u7c97\u5927\u7684\u5f3a\u5e94\u53d8\u53d8\u5f62\u4e9a\u6676\u7c92\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u706b\u661f\u5730\u58f3\u5728\u665a\u671f\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7eaa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u706b\u661f\u9668\u77f3NWA 7721\u4e2d\u6a44\u6984\u77f3\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u706b\u661f\u5730\u58f3\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6697\u573aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u663e\u5fae\u955c(DFXM)\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u80cc\u6563\u5c04\u884d\u5c04(EBSD)\u548c\u539f\u4f4d2D\u5fae\u533aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6a44\u6984\u77f3\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a44\u6984\u77f3\u6676\u4f53\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e9a\u6676\u7c92\uff1aType 1\u4e3a\u7ec6\u5c0f(1-5\u5fae\u7c73)\u3001\u968f\u673a\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u518d\u7ed3\u6676\u4ea7\u7269\uff1bType 2\u4e3a\u7c97\u5927(>30\u5fae\u7c73)\u3001\u5b9a\u5411\u6392\u5217\u3001\u5f3a\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6b8b\u4f59\u3002Type 2\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6ed1\u79fb\u5e26\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800cType 1\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u3002", "conclusion": "NWA 7721\u6a44\u6984\u77f3\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u706b\u661f\u5730\u58f3\u5728\u665a\u671f\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7eaa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5176\u53cc\u5cf0\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u52a0\u70ed\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e3a2.3\u79d2\u3002"}}

Figure 15 is my favorite!", "summary": "Most star clusters dissolve into the Galaxy over tens to hundreds of millions of years after they form. While recent Gaia studies have honed our view of cluster dispersal, the exact chronology of which star formation events begat which star cluster remnants remains unclear. This problem is acute after 100 Myr, when cluster remnants have spread over hundreds of parsecs and most age estimates for main sequence stars are too imprecise to link the stars to their birth events. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that combines TESS stellar rotation rates with Gaia kinematics to identify diffuse remnants of open clusters. We apply our method to the Pleiades, which previous studies have noted shows kinematic similarities to other nearby young stellar groups. We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure that contains multiple known clusters distributed over 600 pc. We refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex. On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud. This work establishes a scalable approach for tracing the genealogies of nearby clusters and further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics.

By jointly analysing HARPS-N RVs, TESS, and CHEOPS photometric data and using two different stellar activity mitigation techniques, we constrain planet b's mass to $6.0^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and $8.5^{+1.3}_{-1.4} $ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$, depending on the mitigation technique. We investigate the dependence of these results on the priors, data selection, and inclusion of other Keplerians in the modelling. Using this approach, we identify the presence of two non-transiting planetary companions with minimum masses near 10 $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and orbital periods of 35.7 and 89 days.

However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u548cU-Net\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u4e09\u7ef4\u5355\u8272\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u5438\u6536-\u53d1\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc72\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5149\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u901f\u4e0e\u5929\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5178\u578b\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408U-Net\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u7ef4\u3001\u5355\u8272\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5438\u6536-\u53d1\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc72\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\u57283%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u9ad8\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing age-dating techniques are limited in terms of both the spectral type and age range they can accurately probe, and many are unreliable for stars older than 1 Gyr. Recent studies have suggested that a star's X-ray luminosity correlates strongly with stellar age and shows a steep fall-off at ages older than 1 Gyr. In this work, we present X-ray luminosity relationship values from eROSITA for four previously unassessed stars. Additionally, we reassess the X-ray luminosity/age relationship present in 24 main-sequence stars older than a gigayear. We confirm that a correlation does appear to exist between stellar age and X-ray luminosity at ages older than 1 Gyr. However, we measure a shallower slope with age than previous research for older stars, similar to what was found for younger stars. We also find evidence for significant astrophysical variability in a star's X-ray luminosity, which will likely limit the precision with which X-ray measurements can yield age estimates. We also find weak evidence for mass dependence in the X-ray luminosity/age relationship. These results suggest that although X-ray luminosity correlates with stellar age, it may not serve as a reliable standalone age indicator and is better used as part of a broader suite of age-dating methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7eROSITA\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6052\u661fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u5e74\u7684\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u659c\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5e73\u7f13\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5e74\u9f84\u6307\u793a\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6052\u661f\u5e74\u9f84\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u5e74\u7684\u6052\u661f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u6d4b\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528eROSITA\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e864\u9897\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6052\u661f\u548c24\u9897\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u5e74\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6/\u5e74\u9f84\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u5728\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u5e74\u7684\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u659c\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5e73\u7f13\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u5f31\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u867d\u7136\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5e74\u9f84\u6307\u793a\u5668\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u5e74\u9f84\u6d4b\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}
