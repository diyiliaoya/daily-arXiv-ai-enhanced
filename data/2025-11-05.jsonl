We evolve\nsynthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated\nmodels for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both\ninternal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both\nevolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field\nenvironments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment\nsimilar to the Cygnus OB2 association.

This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which\nrelates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the\nenvelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a\nmultiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal\nvalue for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE\nwith RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without\ncorotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the\npost-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius.\nThis trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and\nsupergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes.\nTherefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final\nseparation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has\nbeen liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial\nplunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later\nstages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE\nobservations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our\nresults reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is\ntreated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single\nevent governed by alpha."}

We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV\ncontinuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are\nvariable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary\nonly in flux.

Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is\ntherefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions\nof Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with\nvarious physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs\nexhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed\nquasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking\nparallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from\nreference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality\nindex for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability.

Using inferred birth radii and stellar\nages, we identify signatures of dynamical and chemical evolution across the LMC\ndisk.

These events\nexhibit distinct spatial patterns -- initially concentrated in the inner disk\nat 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed\ncentral activity at 1 Gyr -- likely reflecting changes in spin alignment\nbetween the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter\npassages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the\nLMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr.

We model this\nexcess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with\ntemperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that\nASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the\ndimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar\nvariability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive\nflat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation\nevents reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra\nobtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the\nocculting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress\nphases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the\nobscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent\nwith a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses\nand surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly\n0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared\nexcess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion,\napproximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving\ngas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby\nobject within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of\nabout 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up\nwill help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar\nenvironment."}

We find that the correlation between these two\nparameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass\ndoubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star\nformation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the\nmain sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the\ngalaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back\ntimes, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends\nup in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on\ntheir current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired\ngalaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas\ngalaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR\ninitially.

We evolve\nsynthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated\nmodels for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both\ninternal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both\nevolution scenarios.

As a first case study, we investigate the low-latitude\nglobular cluster M9. We compare the Gaia photometry and color data of the\ncluster member RR Lyrae stars to field RR Lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes\nand whose photometric metallicities match that of M9, as well as to theoretical\nmodels. We calculate the dereddened Gaia colors for the M9 stars based on three\nzero points. We confirm that the original SFD map appears to be overcorrecting\nthe reddening for at least some RR Lyrae stars, albeit not excessively. In\ncontrast, the 3D Bayestar map and the recalibrated version of the SFD map\nprovide physically plausible reddenings, which we accept as lower and upper\nlimits for M9, respectively. Our results provide a physically motivated\nreddening range for M9, and outline a methodology that can be directly extended\nto other globular clusters that are accessible to the Gaia mission, and to\nother multicolor sky surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory."}

However, the relative\ncontribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of\ntheir observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved\nemission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally\nand magnetically driven winds in protoplanetary discs. We modelled three disc\nwind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly\nmagnetised wind ($\\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\\beta$6), and a\npurely photoevaporative wind (PE). Using radiative transfer post-processing, we\ngenerated synthetic emission maps and line profiles for [OI] 6300 \\r{A}, [NeII]\n12.81 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m, and o-H2 2.12 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m, and compared them with\nobservations. The $\\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more\nblueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact\nemission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\\beta$6 and PE models yield\nnarrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most\nobserved narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line\nprofile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are\nnot robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at\nhalf-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable\nconstraints. The $\\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs\nin observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the\n$\\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most\nobserved NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative\nflows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers\nmeaningful constraints on wind-driving physics."}
