Structures of molecular outflows", "comment": "24 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "As part of the ALMA Large Program \"Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks\" (eDisk), 12CO (2 - 1) was observed towards 19 nearby low-mass protostars. Of these objects, 15 sources are found to show molecular outflow emission. Based on their morphological and kinematical structures, the CO outflows are classified into three types: a wind-driven shell, where ambient material is swept up by a wide-angle wind from the star, a bow shock, and a slow disk wind, which is a conical or parabolic flow with onion-like velocity structure. We categorize 11 outflows as a slow disk wind, 7 as a wind-driven shell, and 1 as a bow shock. Four of these outflows were found to show signs of both slow disk wind and wind-driven shell characteristics. Five objects show misalignment between the red- and blue-shifted outflows. Seven objects show significant misalignment between the outflow axis (either or both of the red- and blue-shifted outflows) and the minor axis of the dust continuum emission around the protostar. For the objects showing wind-driven shell emission, we compare simple parametrized models with the observations to derive physical properties of the observed shells, such as their dynamical ages. This shows evidence of a time variability in the outflows, such as changes in their direction. In some objects, large differences are seen between the properties of the red- and blue-shifted outflows, possibly indicating differences in the properties of the ambient medium with which the outflow interacts."}

Baliukin", "Merav Opher"], "title": "The Effect of Magnetic Field Dissipation in the Inner Heliosheath: Reconciling Global Heliosphere Model and Voyager Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Global ideal magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere typically predict a greatly exaggerated magnetic field pile-up in the inner heliosheath (IHS), the region between the termination shock and heliopause. However, Voyager 1 and 2 observations show only a gradual increase throughout this region. This mismatch is largely attributed to the simplified assumption of a unipolar solar magnetic field in many global models, which neglects the complex, folded structure of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The IHS, especially at low heliolatitudes, contains these compressed sector boundaries, widely considered prime locations for magnetic dissipation via reconnection. To align global model simulations with observations without incurring the prohibitive computational cost of resolving the kinetic-scale current sheet, this work introduces a phenomenological term into the magnetic field induction equation. This term captures the macroscopic effect of magnetic energy dissipation due to unresolved HCS dynamics. It is designed to mitigate the artificial magnetic pile-up, preserve the topological integrity of the magnetic field lines, and avoid explicit magnetic diffusion. This study demonstrates that incorporating a phenomenological dissipation term into global heliospheric models helps to resolve the longstanding discrepancy between simulated and observed magnetic field profiles in the IHS. The proposed mechanism reduces exaggerated magnetic energy (converts it into thermal energy), aligns model output with Voyager measurements of both magnetic field and proton density, and produces the outward shift in termination shock position and a reduction of the IHS thickness. We found that the characteristic time for magnetic field dissipation of about 6 years provides improved agreement with Voyager data in the IHS."}

Solar blowout jets are a distinct subclass of ubiquitous extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal jets. Aims. Most existing models of blowout jets prescribe an initial magnetic field configurations and apply ad-hoc changes in the photosphere to trigger the jets. In contrast, we aim for a self-consistent magneto-convective description of the jet initiation. Methods. We employ a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar coronal hole region using the MURaM code. The computational domain extends from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. We synthesize the emission in the extreme UV and X-rays for a direct comparison to observations and examine the evolution of the magnetic field structure of the event. Results. In the simulation a twisted flux tube forms self-consistently, emerges through the surface and interacts with the pre-existing open field. Initially the resulting jet is of the standard type with a narrow spire. The release of the twist into the open field causes a broadening of the jet spire turning the jet into a blowout type. At the same time this creates a fast heating front propagating at the local Alfvén speed. The properties of the modeled jet closely match observations of blowout jets: a slow (180 km/s) mass upflow and a fast (500 km/s) propagating front form, the latter being a signature of the heating front. Also the timing of the jet with respect to the flux emergence and subsequent cancellation matches observations. Conclusions. The near-surface magneto-convection self-consistently generates a twisted flux tube that emerges through the photosphere. The tube then interacts with the pre-existing magnetic field by means of interchange reconnection. This transfers the twist to the open field region and produces a blowout jet that matches the main characteristics of this type of jet found in observations."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has identified various chemical species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, including neutral and ionized metals, providing key insights into planet formation through refractory element abundances. We observed the dayside thermal emission spectrum of the UHJ HAT-P-70b using the high-resolution spectrographs CARMENES and PEPSI. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detect emission signals of Al i, AlH, Ca ii, Cr i, Fe i, Fe ii, Mg i, Mn i, and Ti i, marking the first detection of Al i and AlH in an exoplanetary atmosphere. Tentative signals of C i, Ca i, Na i, NaH, and Ni i are also identified. These detections enable atmospheric retrievals to constrain the thermal profile and elemental abundances of the planet's dayside hemisphere. The retrieved temperature-pressure profile reveals a strong thermal inversion. The chemical free retrieval yields a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.38(+0.74/-1.11), while the chemical equilibrium retrieval gives [Fe/H] = 0.23(+1.08/-0.98), both consistent with solar metallicity. We also tentatively find an enhanced abundance of Ni, possibly due to the accretion of Ni-rich planetesimals during formation. On the other hand, elements with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (e.g., Ca, Ti, and V) appear slightly depleted, which may be caused by nightside cold trapping. However, Al, with the highest condensation temperature at 1653K, displays a solar like abundance, which might reflect the formation-related enrichment of Al. Our retrieval indicates extremely high volume mixing ratios of metal ions (Fe ii and Ca ii), which are significantly inconsistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models. This disequilibrium suggests that the atmosphere is likely undergoing significant hydrodynamic escaping, which enhances the atmospheric density at high altitudes where the ionic lines are formed."}

These bursts are typically found close to expanding coronal mass ejections (CMEs), making them valuable for studying the properties and dynamics of CME-driven shocks in the solar corona. Here, we aim to determine the regions in the solar corona where shock waves accelerate electrons and determine their characteristic properties. To do this, we combine radio observations of type II solar radio bursts with magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona. We analyse ten type II radio bursts from Solar Cycle 25 exhibiting emissions. The novelty of this study lies in using radio imaging data for all type II bursts to examine the positions of the radio sources. The radio source positions, combined with a geometrical fitting of the CME shock and the MHD simulations, are used to determine essential shock parameters at the acceleration region, such as the Alfvén Mach number $(M_{\\rm A}$ and $θ_{\\rm BN}$. The shock parameters are then combined with the properties of the radio emission and the associated eruption in a comprehensive study. We found that for all events, the type II bursts are located near or inside coronal streamers. The estimated shock speeds are high, resulting in the formation of super-critical shocks $(3.6~\\leq~M_{\\rm A}~\\leq~6.4$) at the type II locations. In most events, type II bursts are located at oblique shocks rather than near-perpendicular geometries, suggesting that the shock structure is more complex at local scales than the simple spherical shock models usually applied to CME shocks. Our results suggest that CME-streamer interaction regions are necessary for the generation of type II bursts, as they provide ideal plasma conditions for the formation of super-critical shocks and the subsequent acceleration of electrons."}

Radioisotope dating of planetesimal disruption events recorded in meteorites confirms frequent catastrophic collisions in the first $\\sim$10 Myr of the Solar System, reflecting a violent environment of the time. However, the nebula gas can damp the eccentricity of planetesimals and suppress the frequency of planetesimal collisions. Strong dynamical mechanisms that excited the protoplanetary disk are required. Here we show that the sweeping secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn induced by the nebular gas dissipation, together with the mean motion resonances of Jupiter, can trigger a large number of catastrophic collisions, which occur episodically when the secular resonances are at $\\sim$2-3 au and continue thereafter. After the gas dissipation completes, catastrophic collisions decrease in frequency, with scattering by planetary embryos becoming the major driving force of the collisions. Our results suggest that the violent environment excited by secular and mean motion resonances can be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks during nebula dissipation."}

Using high-cadence imaging from the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), we examine eight flare sequences (seven C-class and one B-class) obtained between 2021 and 2025. Fixed, detector-coordinate regions of interest are used to generate mean-intensity light curves, which are detrended and smoothed to isolate impulsive brightenings. In every event, a compact Ca II K brightening is detected within or adjacent to the flaring region that peaks 10--45 min before the primary kernel and the corresponding rise in GOES 1--8 Å flux. The measured temporal offsets scale with the deprojected separation between the brightening and flare kernels, implying an apparent propagation speed of $\\sim$30--35 km s$^{-1}$ that is consistent with chromospheric reconnection. Complementary Spectropolarimeter for Infrared and Optical Regions (SPINOR) spectropolarimetry for one event shows topological reconfiguration from closed to open or extended connectivity, supporting a reconnection-driven origin. These results demonstrate that compact Ca II K brightenings are reproducible, physically meaningful precursors to flare onset. Their simplicity and cadence make them attractive chromospheric indicators, and future work will evaluate their predictive skill alongside established UV/EUV and magnetic diagnostics."}

However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections."}

These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift."}

Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \\pm 0.8\\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\\ \\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \\times 10^{11}\\ M_\\odot$."}

With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. This work serves as a proof of concept that simple neural networks can be used for emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena of microscopic simulations.

In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN < t_shear < t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics."}

WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be \"native\" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking."}

However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections."}

Of these objects, 15 sources are found to show molecular outflow emission. Based on their morphological and kinematical structures, the CO outflows are classified into three types: a wind-driven shell, where ambient material is swept up by a wide-angle wind from the star, a bow shock, and a slow disk wind, which is a conical or parabolic flow with onion-like velocity structure. We categorize 11 outflows as a slow disk wind, 7 as a wind-driven shell, and 1 as a bow shock. Four of these outflows were found to show signs of both slow disk wind and wind-driven shell characteristics. Five objects show misalignment between the red- and blue-shifted outflows. Seven objects show significant misalignment between the outflow axis (either or both of the red- and blue-shifted outflows) and the minor axis of the dust continuum emission around the protostar. For the objects showing wind-driven shell emission, we compare simple parametrized models with the observations to derive physical properties of the observed shells, such as their dynamical ages. This shows evidence of a time variability in the outflows, such as changes in their direction. In some objects, large differences are seen between the properties of the red- and blue-shifted outflows, possibly indicating differences in the properties of the ambient medium with which the outflow interacts."}

In this study, we develop a physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that incorporates cosmic-ray flux modulation as an additional precursor signal. As coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven disturbances propagate through the heliosphere, enhanced turbulence and magnetic-field compression reduce galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) flux measured by ground-based neutron monitors (Forbush decreases), providing early information that can precede near-Earth solar-wind signatures by 1--3 days. We integrate multi-source space-weather data, spanning 1995-2020, including cosmic-ray observations, solar wind plasma parameters, interplanetary magnetic-field data, and geomagnetic indices. Based on these data, we construct a 19-dimensional feature vector that includes flux background levels, decrease-related indicators, and inter-station correlation measures as model inputs. Employing a 50-unit LSTM architecture, the proposed model achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 5.106 nT, 8.315 nT, 10.854 nT, 12.883 nT, and 14.788 nT for 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. Incorporating cosmic-ray information further improves 48-hour forecast skill by up to 25.84% (from 0.178 to 0.224).
