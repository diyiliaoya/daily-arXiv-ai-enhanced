The Evolution of Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra in Galaxies", "comment": "18 pages, 17 figures. Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are key tracers of non-thermal processes in galaxies, yet their spectra are often modelled under the untested assumption of steady state between injection and cooling. In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components."}

However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge Sérsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST."}

The bulk properties of such planets are consistent with a range of possible internal structures, which can be distinguished through their interactions with the observable atmospheres. JWST observations of TOI-270 d, a temperate sub-Neptune, have previously led to contrasting conclusions: either a Hycean world, possessing a liquid water ocean, or a mixed-envelope sub-Neptune, where high temperatures prevent a liquid ocean and lead to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere. In order to resolve this uncertainty, we present a comprehensive retrieval analysis of TOI-270 d using recent NIRISS and NIRSpec transit spectroscopy across $\\sim$1-5 $μ$m. We find that prior inferences of a mixed envelope were affected by specific modelling choices leading to a high terminator temperature and high mean-molecular weight in the atmosphere. We confirm an H$_2$-rich atmosphere in TOI-270 d and present revised constraints on the molecular log-mixing ratios and maximal detection significances of CH$_4$ at $-1.86^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$ (6.4 $σ$), CO$_2$ at $-1.71^{+0.38}_{-0.66}$ (3.9 $σ$), H$_2$O at $-1.88^{+0.78}_{-4.13}$ (2.1 $σ$) and CS$_2$ at $-4.74^{+0.65}_{-1.10}$ (2.0 $σ$), with a terminator temperature of $323^{+58}_{-52}$ K at 10 mbar. We also find tentative evidence for more complex methyl-bearing species such as C$_2$H$_6$ and/or DMS at a 2.1-2.5 $σ$ level. The present constraints are consistent with TOI-270 d being a Hycean or dark Hycean world, with planet-wide or nightside liquid water oceans. However, more observations are required to verify the present findings and robustly constrain the atmospheric conditions and internal structure of TOI-270 d."}

The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows."}

Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\\gtrsim20\\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies.

Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena."}

We have made observations targeting absorption lines of H$_3^+$, one of the most reliable tracers of $ζ({\\rm H_2})$, toward diffuse molecular cloud sight lines where the H$_2$ column density has been directly measured in the ultraviolet, detecting H$_3^+$ in 12 out of 27 sight lines.

By associating H$_3^+$ absorption with gas density peaks derived from the differential extinction maps of Edenhofer et al.

Specific regions show reasonably uniform ionization rates over length scales of tens of parsecs, with the average ionization rate in each region being different. Large differences (factor of 5) in $ζ({\\rm H_2})$ are found over length scales of about 100 pc. This supports a picture where the cosmic-ray ionization rate varies smoothly over small size scales, but is not uniform everywhere in the Galactic disk, likely being controlled by proximity to particle acceleration sites."}

Small telescopes offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, occupy less space, and are simpler to set up than larger instruments. This makes them particularly suitable for amateur astronomers and educational institutions with limited resources. Moreover, small telescopes can effectively observe bright celestial objects, enabling valuable contributions to astronomical projects. Based on the Sol'EX design, SPECTRUMMATE was constructed using optical components available at the Space and Applications Laboratory (SpaceLAB), University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam. The instrument is designed to meet the specific needs of astronomers who require detailed analysis within the visible spectrum (SPECTRUMMATE can capture a waveband of 368 angstrom/image, spectral coverage from 4000 to 6600 angstrom, and resolving power R = 2546 at 5500 angstrom). To achieve optimal performance, the design process involved selecting and configuring optical elements, including a collimator, diffraction grating, and objective lens. Experimental setups were tested to minimize spectral dispersion while ensuring the system's compactness and ease of alignment. Spectra obtained by SPECTRUMMATE demonstrated efficient spectral calibration and the capability to capture high-resolution spectra of bright light sources, such as the Sun, making it a valuable tool for specialised spectroscopic observations. The modular design of SPECTRUMMATE also allows users to change its components easily to achieve the desired spectral range and resolution."}

Here we present the first framework for inferring planet and disk parameters from such images using variational autoencoder (VAE) based generative machine learning (ML). The new framework is called VADER (Variational Autoencoder for Disks with Embedded Rings). We train VADER on synthetic images of dust continuum emission, generated from \\texttt{FARGO3D} hydrodynamic simulations post-processed with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. VADER infers the masses of up to three embedded planets as well as the disk parameters viscous $α$, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, and flaring index. VADER returns a full posterior distribution for each of these quantities. We demonstrate that VADER reconstructs disk morphologies with high structural similarity (index $>$ 0.99), accurately recovers planet parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ across planet masses, and reliably predicts disk parameters. Applied to ALMA dust continuum images of 23 protoplanetary disks, our model returns mass estimates for embedded planets of 0.3-2~$M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ that agree to within $1σ$ of published values in most cases, and infers disk parameters consistent with current literature. Once trained, the VAE performs full posterior parameter inference in a matter of minutes, offering statistical rigor with enough computational speed for application to large-scale ALMA surveys. These results establish VAE-based models as powerful tools for inferring from disk structure the masses of embedded planets and the global disk parameters, with their associated uncertainties."}

These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes."}

The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \\lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly."}

The method is tested extensively using fields that are not crowded, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and M31 (Field 13). The results are compared with previous studies that used UVIT observations. This approach is successful in detecting fainter sources and produces a large number of new sources ($\\sim 15$ to $92\\%$ more).

Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution."}

This passage marks the first to be observed with modern, state-of-the-art instruments. We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data. In addition, we update the expansion parallax distance of R Aqr to 260 pc."}

The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\\pm0.10$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament. We speculate that mechanical feedback from the AGN jet could be playing a role in triggering SF in the UV knot."}

A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data."}

Due to the unique design of KPF, we developed a publicly available pipeline for KPF that performs blaze removal, continuum normalization, order stitching, science spectra combination, telluric correction, and atmospheric detection via cross-correlation. As a first demonstration, we applied this pipeline to a transit of WASP-76 b and achieved some of the highest signal-to-noise detections of refractory species in WASP-76 b to date (e.g., Fe I is detected at a SNR of 14.5). We confirm previous observations of an asymmetry in Fe I absorption, but find no measurable ingress-egress asymmetry in Na I and Ca II. Together, these results suggest variations within different layers of the atmosphere of WASP-76 b: neutral metals such as Fe I trace deeper regions with stronger asymmetries, while Na I and Ca II probe regions higher in the atmosphere where the ingress-egress asymmetries are weaker. These findings provide new insights into the complex atmosphere of WASP-76 b and highlight the power of using KPF for atmospheric characterization. More broadly, the KPF SURFS-UP Survey will observe a large sample of UHJs, using transmission, emission, and phase-resolved spectroscopy to characterize their refractory abundances, upper atmospheres, and 3D dynamics."}

For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure."}

This study presents an updated catalogue of 620 exoplanet ephemerides, integrating 30000 measurements from ground-based telescopes (the ExoClock network), literature, and space telescopes (Kepler, K2 and TESS). The updated catalogue includes 277 planets from TESS which require special observing strategies due to their shallow transits or bright host stars. This study demonstrates that data from larger telescopes and the employment of new methodologies such as synchronous observations with small telescopes, are capable of monitoring special cases of planets. The new ephemerides show that 45% of the planets required an update while the results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in prediction uncertainty. The collective analysis also enabled the identification of new planets showing TTVs, highlighting the importance of extensive observing coverage. Developed in the context of the ESA's Ariel space mission, with the goal of delivering a catalogue with reliable ephemerides to increase the mission efficiency, ExoClock's scope and service have grown well beyond the remit of Ariel. The ExoClock project has been operating in the framework of open science, and all tools and products are accessible to everyone within academia and beyond, to support efficient scheduling of future exoplanet observations, especially from larger telescopes where the pressure for time allocation efficiency is higher (Ariel, JWST, VLT, ELT, Subaru etc). The inclusion of diverse audiences in the process and the collaborative mode not only foster democratisation of science but also enhance the quality of the results."}

The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far.\n  Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å).\n  Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied.\n  Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino.\n  Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest."}

Thanks to the capabilities of new generation telescopes and computers, a growing amount of observational and theoretical results have been recently obtained, which have important implications not only for our understanding of the (still mysterious) formation process of high-mass stars, but also for the chemistry that the primordial Solar System might have inherited from its birth environment. In this review, we summarise the main observational and theoretical results achieved in the last decades in the study of chemistry evolution in high-mass star-forming regions, and in the identification of chemical evolutionary indicators. Emphasis is especially given to observational studies, for which most of the work has been carried out so far. A comparison with the chemical evolution occurring in other astrophysical environments, in particular in low-mass star-forming cores and extragalactic cores, is also briefly presented. Current open questions and future perspectives are discussed."}

Here we present the first framework for inferring planet and disk parameters from such images using variational autoencoder (VAE) based generative machine learning (ML). The new framework is called VADER (Variational Autoencoder for Disks with Embedded Rings). We train VADER on synthetic images of dust continuum emission, generated from \\texttt{FARGO3D} hydrodynamic simulations post-processed with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. VADER infers the masses of up to three embedded planets as well as the disk parameters viscous $α$, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, and flaring index. VADER returns a full posterior distribution for each of these quantities. We demonstrate that VADER reconstructs disk morphologies with high structural similarity (index $>$ 0.99), accurately recovers planet parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ across planet masses, and reliably predicts disk parameters. Applied to ALMA dust continuum images of 23 protoplanetary disks, our model returns mass estimates for embedded planets of 0.3-2~$M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ that agree to within $1σ$ of published values in most cases, and infers disk parameters consistent with current literature. Once trained, the VAE performs full posterior parameter inference in a matter of minutes, offering statistical rigor with enough computational speed for application to large-scale ALMA surveys. These results establish VAE-based models as powerful tools for inferring from disk structure the masses of embedded planets and the global disk parameters, with their associated uncertainties."}

The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature."}

At each $μ$-position, the spectra are spatially averaged over 0.02 $μ$, and the resulting CLVs are given both as these averaged data points and as smooth polynomial curves fitted across each wavelength point. The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift."}

Kinematic structure of young and intermediate-age clusters", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A, 21 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "In this paper, we explore the kinematic properties of a sample of 19 young (<1 Gyr) and intermediate-age (1-2.5 Gyr) massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We analyse the proper motions of the clusters, which have been measured based on multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we infer from the HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for the distances, ages and metallicities of the clusters. This collection of information, in combination with literature line-of-sight velocities, allows us to investigate the full 3D dynamics of our sample of clusters within the frame of the LMC in a self-consistent way. While most young clusters orbit the LMC close to the stellar disc plane, NGC 1850 (~100 Myr old) depicts a peculiar case. Depending on the exact distance from the disc, it follows either a highly inclined, retrograde orbit or an eccentric orbit along the bar structure. The orbits of young clusters that formed North of the LMC centre show signs that might be connected to the resettling motion of the LMC bar structure. Based on the dynamic properties in combination with the positions of the clusters in the age-metallicity space, we find no clear-cut evidence for clusters in our sample that could have been stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) onto the LMC. We finally compare the kinematics of the intermediate-age clusters with a suite of simple numerical simulations of the Magellanic system to interpret the cluster motions. A possible interaction history of the LMC with the SMC, where the SMC had two past crossings of the LMC disc plane (about 300 and 900 Myr ago), in combination with the recent SMC pericentre passage, can qualitatively explain the observed kinematic structure of the clusters analysed in this work."}

We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%.

The crater formed exhibits a rim-to-rim diameter of $35 \\pm 0.7$ m, a depth of $4.9 \\pm 0.4$ m, and an ejecta blanket extending over 2 km with an area of approximately $7 \\times 10^{5}\\,$m$^{2}$. The ejecta shows a pronounced asymmetry and, assuming uniform distribution, an average thickness limit of $\\sim 2$ mm. Spectral analysis using WAC images reveals a consistent reddening of the central ejecta region, with an average 16.54 % increase in spectral slope between 321 nm and 643 nm, marking the first reported detection of color changes resulting from a lunar impact. We evaluated several scaling laws and found that the Gault et al. (1974) formulation most accurately reproduces the observed crater size. Furthermore, luminous efficiency values below $η= 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ and higher projectile densities are most consistent with the morphology of the ejecta. The impact direction inferred from this pattern is not compatible with the radiant of the September $\\varepsilon$-Perseids stream. Moreover, an independent probability analysis yields a greater than 96 % likelihood that the event was caused by a sporadic meteoroid. Our results also demonstrate the potential of WAC imagery for the automated detection of new lunar craters, which can improve statistical estimates of the current impact flux. This methodology offers a powerful complement to high-resolution imaging, with important implications for both lunar safety and planetary defense."}

The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes. Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars. Methods. Building on the established relation between the BruntVaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings presented in Wu et al. and Guo, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked BruntVaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings. Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution."}

Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments. Finally, we reconstrained the dust opacity spectral index $β$ in the M31 galaxy by combining our new JCMT observations with archival Herschel and Planck data and found that the radial variation of $β$ may not be as large as was proposed by previous studies."}

This study presents an updated catalogue of 620 exoplanet ephemerides, integrating 30000 measurements from ground-based telescopes (the ExoClock network), literature, and space telescopes (Kepler, K2 and TESS). The updated catalogue includes 277 planets from TESS which require special observing strategies due to their shallow transits or bright host stars. This study demonstrates that data from larger telescopes and the employment of new methodologies such as synchronous observations with small telescopes, are capable of monitoring special cases of planets. The new ephemerides show that 45% of the planets required an update while the results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in prediction uncertainty. The collective analysis also enabled the identification of new planets showing TTVs, highlighting the importance of extensive observing coverage. Developed in the context of the ESA's Ariel space mission, with the goal of delivering a catalogue with reliable ephemerides to increase the mission efficiency, ExoClock's scope and service have grown well beyond the remit of Ariel. The ExoClock project has been operating in the framework of open science, and all tools and products are accessible to everyone within academia and beyond, to support efficient scheduling of future exoplanet observations, especially from larger telescopes where the pressure for time allocation efficiency is higher (Ariel, JWST, VLT, ELT, Subaru etc). The inclusion of diverse audiences in the process and the collaborative mode not only foster democratisation of science but also enhance the quality of the results."}

Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission."}

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors."}

We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%.

The crater formed exhibits a rim-to-rim diameter of $35 \\pm 0.7$ m, a depth of $4.9 \\pm 0.4$ m, and an ejecta blanket extending over 2 km with an area of approximately $7 \\times 10^{5}\\,$m$^{2}$. The ejecta shows a pronounced asymmetry and, assuming uniform distribution, an average thickness limit of $\\sim 2$ mm. Spectral analysis using WAC images reveals a consistent reddening of the central ejecta region, with an average 16.54 % increase in spectral slope between 321 nm and 643 nm, marking the first reported detection of color changes resulting from a lunar impact. We evaluated several scaling laws and found that the Gault et al. (1974) formulation most accurately reproduces the observed crater size. Furthermore, luminous efficiency values below $η= 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ and higher projectile densities are most consistent with the morphology of the ejecta. The impact direction inferred from this pattern is not compatible with the radiant of the September $\\varepsilon$-Perseids stream. Moreover, an independent probability analysis yields a greater than 96 % likelihood that the event was caused by a sporadic meteoroid. Our results also demonstrate the potential of WAC imagery for the automated detection of new lunar craters, which can improve statistical estimates of the current impact flux. This methodology offers a powerful complement to high-resolution imaging, with important implications for both lunar safety and planetary defense."}

Comments Welcome", "summary": "We investigate the impact of the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\\,{\\rm kR_{\\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae."}

We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE."}

We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$β$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$β$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\\log_{10} M_\\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR.

Dusty outflows and density-complex ISM in the N-enhanced lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID at z=6.1", "comment": "16 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A on Nov 7th. Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present an analysis on the kinematics and physical properties of the ionized gas in the lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID at z=6.1 based on high-resolution JWST NIRSpec/IFU data in combination with ALMA observations. Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature ($T_e$$\\sim$30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]$λ$5008/[OIII]88$μ$m and [ArIV]$λ$4713/[ArIV]$λ$4742 ratios (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])$\\sim$2.7-3.8), and previous values (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])>4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM$\\sim$210 and $\\sim$1000 kms$^{-1}$) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM$\\sim$60 kms$^{-1}$) in [OIII]$λ$5008 and H$α$. These broad components are heavily extinct (A$_V$$\\sim$1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows ($\\sim$115-500kms$^{-1}$) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1$\\times$10$^7$M$_\\odot$) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario."}

We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE."}

Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission."}

Published in the Astronomical Journal (AJ)", "summary": "We present an improved approach for constructing the UV source catalogs using observations from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, by considering the Poisson distribution of the UV background. The method is tested extensively using fields that are not crowded, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and M31 (Field 13). The results are compared with previous studies that used UVIT observations. This approach is successful in detecting fainter sources and produces a large number of new sources ($\\sim 15$ to $92\\%$ more). Most of the newly discovered UV sources fall in the faint end of the source distribution (m $\\gtrsim 22$). The counterparts at other wavelengths are identified for most sources. This approach is more efficient for source detection and provides an opportunity to explore new classes of UV sources."}

The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature."}

The automated line identifications by PyEMILI demonstrate significant improvements in both completeness and accuracy compared to the previous manual identifications in the literature. Since our last report of PyEMILI, the atomic transition database used by the code has been further expanded by cross-matching the Kurucz Line Lists. Moreover, to aid the PyEMILI identification of numerous faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII, OII and NeII, we compiled a new dataset of effective recombination coefficients for these nebular lines, and created a new subroutine in the code to generate theoretical spectra of heavy-element ORLs at various electron temperature and density cases; these theoretical spectra can be used to fit the observed recombination spectrum of a PN to obtain the electron temperature, density and ionic abundances using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We present MCMC-derived parameters for a sample of PNe. This work establishes PyEMILI as a robust and versatile tool for both line identification and plasma diagnostics in deep spectroscopy of gaseous nebulae."}
