It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants."}

We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions."}

Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\\%, 1.5\\%, and 3.5\\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z>0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations."}

Influence of the internal structure", "comment": "14 pages, 6 figures. Accepted in A&A", "summary": "With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io's heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth's geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects."}

Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $κ= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $κ\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $κ\\to 1.5$ limit."}

Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of $90^\\circ$ and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to \\textit{JWST} imaging of galaxies at $1<z<3$ with stellar masses $\\gtrsim 10^9~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of $z_0 = 0.25\\pm0.14~\\mathrm{kpc}$ and a median ratio $h_r/z_0 = 8.4\\pm3.7$. These values are consistent with the Milky Way and local thin discs, but imply scale heights $\\sim 1.6$ times smaller than those inferred for local galaxies from single-disc fits.

Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations."}

Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability."}

We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions. To interpret these findings, we modeled the collision using the numerical algorithm GCD+. The simulation reproduces key features of the system and demonstrates how close passages drive enhanced star formation and localized chemical enrichment.

Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments.

We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.\n  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window.

It is therefore theorised that brown dwarf companions are unlikely to form or remain in this period range. The Gaia space telescope is uniquely sensitive to companions in this period range, making it an ideal tool to conduct a survey of the brown dwarf desert. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to analyse data from nearby (<200pc) Sun-like stars in Gaia's DR3 catalogue, assuming single companions. From this, we identify 2673 systems (2.41% of the sample) with possible brown dwarf companions in this period range. Accounting for observational biases, we find that 10.4+0.8-0.6% of nearby Sun-like stars have astrometric errors consistent with a brown dwarf-mass companion with a period less than 5 years, significantly higher than previous studies which reported occurrence rates of <1%. However, we acknowledge the limitations of DR3 and are unable to make a definitive statement without epoch data. By simulating epoch data with multiple companions, we find that, while some of the data can be explained by multiple low-mass brown dwarf companions and high-mass planets (>10MJ), high-mass brown dwarfs (>50MJ) in this period range are comparatively rare.

The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers."}

Optical constants of N$_2$ ice in the terahertz and mid-infrared ranges", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A, 9 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.\n  Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.\n  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.\n  Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $ν= 0.3$--$16$~THz ($λ= 1$~mm--$18.75~μ$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $ν_\\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $γ_\\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $α$-N$_2$ crystal.\n  Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \\ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation."}

We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3σ$ upper limit of $30~μ$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $Π_{\\max}\\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $χ_\\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $σ_{\\rm RM}\\sim400~\\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds.

We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (< 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (< 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (> 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters."}

Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data."}

In this work, we develop a feedforward neural network classifier that assigns to each XP spectrum a probability of being an RSG, denoted as $\\mathrm{P(RSG)}$. We perform ten independent runs with randomly divided training and validation sets, and apply each run to all XP spectra of stars with $G < 12$ mag.

A star is considered a ture Galactic RSG only if it appears in at least eight of these samples, yielding a final catalog of 2,436 objects.

First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \\pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair's orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus' atmosphere."}

The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\\sim$5\\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts."}

However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk."}

To explore the nature and evolutionary future of LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1, we complemented archival spectroscopic data with additional time series spectra and high-resolution spectroscopy of the object. After combining these with photometric data, we determined the orbital parameters of the system and the mass of the companion. We solved the orbit of the system by analyzing 68 low- and medium-resolution spectra using state-of-the-art mixed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE model atmospheres. Additionally, we gathered nine high-resolution spectra to determine atmospheric parameters and the projected rotational velocity of the sdOB. The inclination angle of the system was constrained assuming tidal synchronization of the sdOB, which was verified via analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the TESS light curve.

The striking dichotomy of aligned and perpendicular orbital configurations are suggestive of obliquity excitation through secular resonance -- a process where the precession of a hot Neptune becomes locked onto a forcing frequency, and is slowly guided into a perpendicular state. Previous models of resonant capture have involved the presence of companion perturbers to the star-planet-disk system, but in most cases, such companions are not confirmed to be present. In this work, we present a mechanism for exciting Neptunes to polar orbits in systems without giant perturbers, where photo-evaporation is the self-contained mechanism. Photo-evaporation opens a gap in the protoplanetary disk at ~1 au, and the inner disk continues to viscously accrete onto the host star, precessing quickly due to the perturbation of the outer disk. As the inner disk shrinks, it precesses more slowly, and encounters a resonance with the J2 precession of the Neptune, quickly exciting it to a polar configuration. While likely not applicable to more massive planets which trigger back-reactions onto the disk, this mechanism reproduces the obliquities of small planets in multiple respects."}

Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\\&$ K and H$α$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth's atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments."}

It is therefore theorised that brown dwarf companions are unlikely to form or remain in this period range. The Gaia space telescope is uniquely sensitive to companions in this period range, making it an ideal tool to conduct a survey of the brown dwarf desert. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to analyse data from nearby (<200pc) Sun-like stars in Gaia's DR3 catalogue, assuming single companions. From this, we identify 2673 systems (2.41% of the sample) with possible brown dwarf companions in this period range. Accounting for observational biases, we find that 10.4+0.8-0.6% of nearby Sun-like stars have astrometric errors consistent with a brown dwarf-mass companion with a period less than 5 years, significantly higher than previous studies which reported occurrence rates of <1%. However, we acknowledge the limitations of DR3 and are unable to make a definitive statement without epoch data. By simulating epoch data with multiple companions, we find that, while some of the data can be explained by multiple low-mass brown dwarf companions and high-mass planets (>10MJ), high-mass brown dwarfs (>50MJ) in this period range are comparatively rare. Finally, we used our studies of the brown dwarf distribution to predict the number of companions in the brown dwarf desert we can expect to discover in DR4."}

Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1\"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S."}

They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG."}

The outer break radius can be considered as a dividing radius between the galaxy and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The values of the Rb,outer range from 0.8R_{25} to 1.45R_{25}, where R_{25} is the optical radius of the galaxy. The oxygen abundances in the CGM range from 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.0 to ~ 8.5. The O/H distribution in each of our galaxies also shows the inner break in the radial abundance profile at the radius Rb,inner. The metallicity gradient in the outer part of the galaxy is steeper than in the inner part. The behaviour of the radial abundance distributions in these galaxies can be explained by assuming an interaction with (capture of the gas from) a small companion and adopting the model for the chemical evolution of galaxies with a radial gas flow. The interaction with a companion results in the mixing of gas and a flat metallicity gradient in the CGM. The capture of the gas from a companion increases the radial gas inflow rate and changes the slope of the radial abundance gradient in the outer part of the galaxy."}

In particular, the amount of carbon relative to oxygen is known to have a strong effect on modeled abundances of many species. While previous studies have focused on comparison of modeled and observed abundances to constrain the C/O ratio, the effects of this parameter on the underlying chemistry have not been well-studied. We investigated the role of the C/O ratio on dark cloud chemistry using the NAUTILUS code and machine learning techniques for molecular representation. We find that modeled abundances are quite sensitive to the C/O ratio, especially for carbon-rich species such as carbon chains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). CO and simple ice-phase species are found to be major carbon reservoirs under both oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich conditions. The appearance of C3H4 isomers as significant carbon reservoirs, even under oxygen-rich conditions, indicates the efficiency of gas-phase C3 formation followed by adsorption and grain-surface hydrogenation. Our model is not able to reproduce the observed, gas-phase C/H ratio of TMC-1 CP at the time of best fit with any C/O ratio between 0.1 and 3, suggesting that the modeled freeze-out of carbon-bearing molecules may be too rapid. Future investigations are needed to understand the reactivity of major carbon reservoirs and their conversion to complex organic molecules."}

We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3σ$ upper limit of $30~μ$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $Π_{\\max}\\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $χ_\\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $σ_{\\rm RM}\\sim400~\\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81."}

We perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of both sources in the image plane to study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, finding generally good agreement between the slopes of the SFR versus gas mass surface density using the different tracers. Using lens modeling methods, we find that the dust emission is more compact than the line emission in both sources, with CO(7-6) and [C I](2-1) similar in extent and [C II] the most extended, reminiscent of recent findings of extended [C II] spatial distributions in galaxies at similar cosmic epochs. We develop the [C I](2-1) / CO(7-6) flux density ratio as an observable proxy for gas depletion timescale ($τ_{\\rm dep}$), which can be applied to large samples of DSFGs, in lieu of more detailed inferences of this timescale which require analysis of observations at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the extended [C II] emission in both sources, compared to the total continuum and line emission, suggests that [C II], used in recent years as a molecular gas mass and SFR tracer in high-$z$ galaxies, may not always be a suitable tracer of these physical quantities."}

II. Ejection of low mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems", "comment": "to appear in MNRAS", "summary": "Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic \"pincer movement\" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\\sim 10$\\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter."}

We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier."}

Optical constants of N$_2$ ice in the terahertz and mid-infrared ranges", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A, 9 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.\n  Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.\n  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.\n  Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $ν= 0.3$--$16$~THz ($λ= 1$~mm--$18.75~μ$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $ν_\\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $γ_\\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $α$-N$_2$ crystal.\n  Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \\ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation."}

II. Ejection of low mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems", "comment": "to appear in MNRAS", "summary": "Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic \"pincer movement\" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\\sim 10$\\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter."}

Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms.\n  K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (< 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope.\n  Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage."}

Binarity, infalling streamers, and accretion shocks", "comment": "16 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "(Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1\"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S."}
