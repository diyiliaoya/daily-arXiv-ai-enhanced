Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\\lesssim 30\\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \\ge 2.5\\ \\rm Gyr$. In $\\sim 20\\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys."}

In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk."}

Maciejewski et al. 2021; S. R. Hagey et al. 2022; E. S. Ivshina & J. N. Winn 2022; W. Wang et al. 2024; L. C. Yeh et al. 2024).

Bouma et al. 2020), the cause of the apparent trend for TrES-5 b has not been satisfactorily explained. This work extends the previous observations with 14 new ground-based transits from 2016-2024 and two newly-published midtimes for data from 2007 and 2009. Four TESS sectors (75, 77, 82, and 84) have also been included for the first time. With the new data, the case for a decreasing orbital period is much weaker than before. The revised rate of period change, dP/dt=-5.3 +/- 2.2 ms yr^-1, is less than half that was found in previous work and the preference for a quadratic over a linear model, as measured through Delta BIC_LQ, has been falling since 2020, with a current value of 11. Furthermore, these results are not robust to outliers; removing a single early transit midtime causes the effect to vanish (Delta BIC_LQ = -1). Additionally, no significant periodic signals in the transit timing data are identified. The current data are well explained by a linear ephemeris."}

Investigating the wind kink", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 12 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendix", "summary": "Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\\log(L_\\star/L_\\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\\log(\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{trans}) \\approx -5.16$ from Vink & Gräfener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $Γ_\\mathrm{e} \\approx 0.43$ ($M_\\star \\approx 60M_\\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum."}

Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Ly$α$ escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at $z=6.5676$ to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Ly$α$ escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated ($\\sim$kpc), slit-level ($\\sim$0.1 kpc), and pixel-level ($\\sim$25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing ($μ\\approx 8.3$-$9.1$). A Ly$α$ map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Ly$α$ emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of $\\log M_\\ast = 8.3$-$8.4$ and an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{\\rm UV} = -19.8 \\pm 0.1$. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Ly$α$ emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Ly$α$ escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing $A_V$. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Ly$α$ escape."}

It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "We present the chemical abundances of Fe, alpha- and neutron-capture elements in 12 metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) giant stars, observed with the high-resolution spectrographs UVES/VLT and MIKE/Magellan. These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]<-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]>+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario."}

We cross-match DESI targets with candidate members that are based on Gaia proper motions, positions, and photometry. The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\\sim -9\\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation. Although DESI [$α$/Fe] ratios for Sextans stars with [Fe/H]~$\\gtrsim-2.0$ are in line with literature values, those for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$\\lesssim-2.0$) present a large scatter and strong anti-correlation with metallicity, warranting a caution for using DESI abundances in this regime.

The tidal disruption of accreting bodies is thought to form circumstellar dusty disks, whose emission spectra could offer additional insights into the mineral phases of the accreted solid material. Silicates are detected in the mid-infrared spectra of several disks, but do not fully account for the near-infrared excess in the disks' spectra. Conductive materials, such as metallic iron, are potential sources of near-infrared emissivity. We investigate the role of metallic iron within silicate dust in the observed spectra of the white dwarfs G29-38 and GD56. Using thermal emission spectra calculations, we analyze the abundance of metallic iron in the dust and the disk structure parameters that best fit the observed spectra. We find that metallic-iron-bearing dust enhances the near-infrared opacity, thereby providing a better fit to the G29-38 spectrum for various silicate compositions than metallic-iron-free dust. The best-fit metal-to-silicate mixing ratio is approximately unity, and for Mg-rich pyroxenes, this value is also consistent with G29-38's stellar atmospheric composition within 1-$σ$ observational uncertainties. Based on the spectral fitting and compositional consistency, Fe-rich silicates without metallic iron cannot be ruled out. The observed GD56 spectrum also favors iron-bearing dust. However, the large observational uncertainties of GD56's stellar elemental abundances hinder a precise comparison between the stellar and dust iron abundances. Upcoming high-precision JWST observations will provide a larger sample, enabling statistical analysis of the correlation between the iron abundances in the atmospheres and circumstellar dust of polluted white dwarfs."}

(2025), our framework captures the evolution of the convective core on the MS under arbitrary mass-loss or mass-gain histories, including a treatment for stellar rejuvenation and MS mergers. This new framework yields more massive helium cores at terminal-age MS, more compact radii in stripped MS stars, and systematically higher black hole masses than commonly used prescriptions.

From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling."}

Using advanced, GPU-accelerated $N$-body simulations, we model the gravitational dynamics of a massive planetesimal disk perturbed by an inclined, inner planet. Our simulations reveal that self-gravity fundamentally alters the disk's evolution compared to massless models. It enforces a coherent, semi-rigid precession of the disk and enables the rapid formation of a global warp structure within 0.5 Myr. The warp angle undergoes a damped oscillation, eventually settling into a quasi-equilibrium state.

Furthermore, we derive an empirical relationship that connects the equilibrium warp angle to the physical parameters of the disk and the planet. Applying this relation to HD 110058, we constrain its disk mass to be likely less than 1,000 $M_\\oplus$, offering a new dynamical perspective on the debris disk mass problem."}

While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST."}

They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\\leq10\\,M_\\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\\simeq10^3-10^4 \\,M_\\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe."}

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade."}

The formation of dense dust clumps through this process, however, is possible provided it involves solids with dimensionless stopping times $\\sim 0.1$ in standard discs, which typically corresponds to 1-10 cm-sized particles. This implies that dust coagulation is required for the SI to be an efficient process. Here, we employ unstratified, shearing-box simulations combined with a moment equation for solving the coagulation equation to examine the effect of dust growth on the SI. In dust-rich discs with a dust-to-gas ratio $ε\\gtrsim 1$, coagulation is found to have little impact on the SI; while in dust-poor discs with $ε\\sim 0.01$, we observe the formation of vertically extended filaments through the action of the coagulation instability (CI), which is triggered due to the dependence of coagulation efficiency on dust density. For moderate dust-to-gas ratios $ε\\sim 0.1$ and Stokes numbers $St \\lesssim 0.1$, we find onset of the SI within these filaments, with a linear growth rate significantly higher compared to standard SI. We refer to this regime as coagulation-assisted SI. The synergy between both instabilities in that case leads to isotropic turbulence and dust concentrations that are increased by a factor of $30-40$. As dust continues to grow, SI tends to overcome the effect of the CI such that the nonlinear saturation phase is similar to pure SI. Our results suggest that coagulation, by simply increasing dust size, may facilitate the formation of dense clumps through the SI; even though it has only little effect on its nonlinear evolution."}

Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes."}

In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected."}

Millimeter wavelength observations reveal a distinct, tidally stripped bridge between the two systems. Together with previously reported spiral arm structures at the outer edge of the IRS3A disk and at the inner and outer regions of the IRS3B disk, these features imply that the systems are undergoing a dynamical flyby. Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems."}

We calculated the fragmentation cascades of 39 bright Geminid fireballs, as well as faint video meteors, to derive fragmentation pressures and other physical properties characterizing the meteoroids, such as their bulk densities. Our goal is to describe the mechanical properties across a broad range of initial masses and explain the cause of the observed behavior. We used a physical fragmentation model with a semiautomatic method based on parallel genetic algorithms to fit the radiometric and regular light curve and dynamics data. We also calculated the thermal stress of model bodies with the type of physical properties and trajectories as the observed Geminids. Then, we compared the outcomes of these simulations to our observations. We find that the Geminids are probably cracked by thermal stress in the atmosphere first and then eroded by mechanical forces. The most compact Geminids are in the 20-200 g mass range. The largest observed meteoroids have a wide range of grain sizes, from about 20 um to large, non-fragmenting parts of 1-20 mm in size.

Both mechanisms can operate simultaneously during active region evolution, making their relative contributions challenging to quantify. Here, we analyze the formation of a flux rope in a MURaM radiative magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, which formed and evolved for approximately three hours before an M-class flare. The formation process is quantified by magnetic helicity flux, which drives the non-potential evolution of magnetic field, with its advection and shear terms on the photosphere corresponding to the emergence and photospheric horizontal flows, respectively. Examining the helicity injected into the flux rope through the photosphere, we find both terms increase significantly as the eruption approaches, with the shear term prevailing overall. Height-dependent analysis of helicity flux, together with magnetic field and velocity distributions, further reveals a gradual transition from the shear to the advection term with an increasing altitude, which is driven by magnetic reconnection above the photosphere. Our results provide quantitative evidence that flux cancellation governs flux rope formation, arising naturally from magnetic field reorganization during active region evolution: as flux emergence transports magnetic flux upward, photospheric shearing motions adjust magnetic field and inject helicity into solar atmosphere, and magnetic reconnection ultimately assembles the main body of flux ropes."}

However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups."}

Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions."}

The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context."}

Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\\mathrm{CII}]$--21\\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$σ$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments."}

Here, we report clear signatures of a recent dynamical interaction between the young stellar systems L1448 IRS3A and L1448 IRS3B. Millimeter wavelength observations reveal a distinct, tidally stripped bridge between the two systems. Together with previously reported spiral arm structures at the outer edge of the IRS3A disk and at the inner and outer regions of the IRS3B disk, these features imply that the systems are undergoing a dynamical flyby. Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems."}

We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\\rm 2.04 \\pm 0.32 \\times 10^{-4} \\space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\\rm A_V = 0.21 \\pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations."}

First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$σ$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects."}

Being magnitude limited, its volume completeness decreases going towards distances larger than 30 pc, where late-type targets are progressively less covered. The observed large spread in the colour-magnitude diagram is likely due to the combination of several effects such as metallicity, age, binarity and activity. The strategy we adopted for deriving stellar parameters provides results consistent with those obtained in the literature with different and independent methods."}

Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\\lesssim 30\\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \\ge 2.5\\ \\rm Gyr$. In $\\sim 20\\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC<0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies."}

The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\\sim -9\\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation.

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade."}

In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk."}

However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs)."}

A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance ($σ_{\\rm CV}$) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at $z\\sim10$ which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find $σ_{\\rm CV}=0.96^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $1.46^{+0.54}_{-0.44}$, and $1.71^{+0.72}_{-0.59}$ per NIRCam pointing ($\\sim9.7\\,{\\rm arcmin}^2$, $\\lesssim1.5\\,{\\rm pMpc}$ at $z\\sim10$) for galaxies with M$_{\\rm UV}<-19.5$, $-20$, and $-20.5$. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that $σ_{\\rm CV}$ is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor $\\gtrsim5$ lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease $σ_{\\rm CV}$ by placing galaxies at fixed M$_{\\rm UV}$ in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on $σ_{\\rm CV}$ and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M$_{\\rm UV}$-$M_{\\rm halo}$ relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with $M_{\\rm halo}$ agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging."}

A multi-line study of its gas kinematics", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A, 29 pages, 31 figures, t tables", "summary": "HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk."}

The tidal disruption of accreting bodies is thought to form circumstellar dusty disks, whose emission spectra could offer additional insights into the mineral phases of the accreted solid material. Silicates are detected in the mid-infrared spectra of several disks, but do not fully account for the near-infrared excess in the disks' spectra. Conductive materials, such as metallic iron, are potential sources of near-infrared emissivity. We investigate the role of metallic iron within silicate dust in the observed spectra of the white dwarfs G29-38 and GD56. Using thermal emission spectra calculations, we analyze the abundance of metallic iron in the dust and the disk structure parameters that best fit the observed spectra. We find that metallic-iron-bearing dust enhances the near-infrared opacity, thereby providing a better fit to the G29-38 spectrum for various silicate compositions than metallic-iron-free dust. The best-fit metal-to-silicate mixing ratio is approximately unity, and for Mg-rich pyroxenes, this value is also consistent with G29-38's stellar atmospheric composition within 1-$σ$ observational uncertainties. Based on the spectral fitting and compositional consistency, Fe-rich silicates without metallic iron cannot be ruled out. The observed GD56 spectrum also favors iron-bearing dust. However, the large observational uncertainties of GD56's stellar elemental abundances hinder a precise comparison between the stellar and dust iron abundances. Upcoming high-precision JWST observations will provide a larger sample, enabling statistical analysis of the correlation between the iron abundances in the atmospheres and circumstellar dust of polluted white dwarfs."}

Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data"}

It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository."}

While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST."}

Orbital stability of exoplanets formed around double white dwarfs", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A on 11/12/2025, abstract shortened, 18 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "Planetary formation might occur at different stages of the stellar evolution of compact binaries. In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected."}

A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger.\n  Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We investigate the quenching of galaxies using a mock observational lightcone generated from the Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) L-Galaxies, closely matched to observations from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). The sample is used to study merging, rejuvenation, and visibility times for star-forming, quiescent, and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, to assess the impact on the build-up of the passive galaxy mass functions.\n  We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\\ast\\sim10^{10}$\\,M$_\\odot$) at $z\\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\\ast>10^{10}$\\,M$\\,_\\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1<z<2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\\sim5$ per cent by $z \\simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\\ast < 10^{10}$\\,M$_\\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase. Our findings provide further evidence that low- and high-mass galaxies follow different quenching pathways."}

Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo."}

In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies."}

We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band.

Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\\sim2^{\\prime\\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture.

A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger.\n  Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\\pm0.7\\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics."}

Comments welcome! 20 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+."}

Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\\lesssim 30\\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \\ge 2.5\\ \\rm Gyr$. In $\\sim 20\\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys."}

Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\\log(L_\\star/L_\\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\\log(\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{trans}) \\approx -5.16$ from Vink & Gräfener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $Γ_\\mathrm{e} \\approx 0.43$ ($M_\\star \\approx 60M_\\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum."}

These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]<-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]>+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario."}

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade."}

In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk."}

Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems."}

The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?"}
