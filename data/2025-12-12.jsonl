Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of \"dark\" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars."}

While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars."}

Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\\rm cell}=20$ M$_\\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence."}

In this study, we model the reflection and thermal emission spectra of such atmospheres across the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR regions and simulate their detectability with future mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). We employ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model data, based on Earth's atmosphere, to derive temperature pressure profiles and couple them with a 1D photochemical model to assess the detectability of these molecules in Earth analogs located 10 parsecs away. We investigate the dominant reaction pathways and their contributions to the atmospheric composition of an Earth analog, with a focus on how they shape the resulting molecular signatures. We also examine the role of surface boundary conditions, which indirectly trace the effects of biological and geological processes, on the detectability of these molecules using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts. Our findings indicate that O3 is detectable with both mission concepts, while H2O requires specific surface humidity levels for detection with LIFE and shows only potential detectability with HWO. CO2 is detectable with LIFE. Both N2O and CH4 require continuous surface outgassing for potential detection with LIFE, and CH4 further requires low surface humidity to prevent masking by water features. Our work highlights the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth analogs in the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR domains using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts and offers guidance for the development of future missions operating in these spectral regions."}

However, the enabling technologies do not have flight heritage at the system level, and the concept remains immature to much of the community, meaning no direct-detection synthetic-aperture space-based interferometer has yet flown and an opportunity exists for the UK to take a world leading role. Here we propose the SPace-based InterFerometry Feasibility (SPIFF) Project as a program to address both issues simultaneously by: 1) completing a thorough survey of the science cases across the EM spectrum that would directly benefit from, or be impossible without, space-based interferometry; 2) down selecting key requirements via a Science Traceability Matrix mapping exercise; 3) host a workshop for the UK astronomical community to consolidate these findings; 4) build a technology demonstration mission to raise TRL and achieve flight heritage of critical technologies. Such a program positions the UK as the partner of choice for any future NASA or ESA space-based interferometry mission, allowing the UK to lead groundbreaking scientific discoveries, while also directly benefiting the UK industrial base by advancing domestic exportable technologies and building direct synergy with other UK space priorities. Indeed, the UK is uniquely positioned to lead in space-based interferometry, possessing a rare trifecta of domestic strengths: world-class expertise in ground-based interferometry and space-based instrumentation; commercial entities developing mission-critical technologies; and scientists whose research spans the full range of science cases that would benefit directly from space-based interferometry."}

They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs)."}

The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete.

Key results are shown in Figure 3 and 4", "summary": "Stellar orbits in the Galactic disc evolve from their birth to the current shape through both radial migration and dynamical heating. The history of their secular evolution is imprinted in the current kinematics and age-metallicity distribution. We construct a chrono-chemo-dynamical model of the disc, incorporating inside-out growth, metallicity evolution, radial migration, and heating to fit the observed age-metallicity-kinematics distribution of LAMOST subgiant stars in both the low and high-$α$ disc. By modelling all distribution parameters with spline fitting, we present the first non-parametric stellar migration and heating history of the Galaxy. We determine the heating-to-migration ratio, the ratio of the root-mean-square changes in radial/vertical and azimuthal actions, to be $\\approx0.075$ for radial to azimuthal actions and $\\approx0.015$ for vertical to azimuthal actions, implying a highly anisotropic diffusion in the action space. Furthermore, we identify a transition in radial migration efficiency coinciding with the transition moment of the bimodal disc, for which the radial migration was more efficient for the high-$α$ disc than for the low-$α$ disc. This transition may be attributed to two correlated scenarios: 1) a bar formation epoch accompanied by violent outward migration, and 2) a drop in the gas mass fraction in the disc when the low-$α$ disc began to form. These findings offer further constraints on the formation mechanisms of bimodal discs, favouring the downsizing scenario. We also briefly discuss the connection between our results and recent high-redshift observations. In addition to the secular evolution history, our model maps the Milky Way ISM metallicity gradient at different lookback times, which we find has only varied a little (in the range of $-0.07~\\rm to~-0.10~dex/kpc$) since disc formation."}

Impact of the He-flash discontinuity and of induced semi-convection", "comment": "12 pages, 15 figures. Version of the manuscript before the language editor", "summary": "Space missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have made asteroseismology a powerful probe of stellar interiors. Red giants are key targets thanks to their rich mixed-mode oscillation spectra, which reveal properties of both core and envelope. However, current models of core helium-burning red giants still fail to fully reproduce observed oscillation patterns, largely due to uncertainties in mixing processes such as overshooting and semi-convection. This motivates the need for better seismic constraints to refine stellar models. We investigate how internal structural features shape asteroseismic signatures in core helium-burning stars, focusing on the links between seismic properties and internal chemical profiles. Using an updated version of the Liege stellar evolution code and its adiabatic oscillation code, we compute and analyse mixed-mode patterns for a range of stellar models. Our results show that sharp chemical gradients and central overshooting strongly influence the mixed-mode spectra. Changes in overshooting modify the extent of the semi-convective region, altering the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency and thus the observed period spacing. Variations in overshooting are compensated by shifts in semi-convective layers, keeping the total mixed-core size nearly constant across models. As a result, stellar evolution is only mildly affected, while the seismic signatures, especially the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, are highly sensitive to these internal adjustments."}

These include either the need for an impactor with a near-identical composition to Earth or an extremely high-mass or high-energy impact to achieve near-complete material mixing. In this paper we explore an alternative, the \"multiple impact hypothesis\", which relaxes the compositional constraints on both the target and projectile, and allows for the consideration of more probable, less extreme impacts that steadily grow the Earth and Moon to their current size over several impact events. Using the hydrodynamical code SWIFT, we simulate \"chains\" of impacts and follow the growth of a moon around a planet analogous to our own. Our results demonstrate that chains of three or more impacts can produce systems comparable to the Earth-Moon system whilst achieving higher compositional similarities than the canonical giant impact scenario. This presents the multiple impact hypothesis as a promising alternative to the single large impact scenario for the origin of the Moon."}

However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set.

The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \\pm 0.08)\\times 10^{-2}\\,{M}_\\odot/{\\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk.

The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions."}

These observations also indicated higher-than-expected CO$_2$ abundances on both planets, implying bulk compositions with high water mass fractions.

Intriguingly, despite LP 791-18c's radius, mass, and equilibrium temperature being in between those of K2-18b and TOI-270d, we find a drastically different transmission spectrum. While we also detect methane on LP 791-18c, its transit spectrum is dominated by strong haze scattering and there is no discernible CO$_2$ absorption. Overall, we infer a deep metal-enriched atmosphere (246-415$\\times$solar) for LP 791-18c, with a CO$_2$-to-CH$_4$ ratio smaller than 0.07 (at 2$σ$), indicating less H$_2$O in the deep envelope of LP 791-18c and implying a relatively dry formation inside the water ice-line. These results show that sub-Neptunes that are near-analogues in density and temperature can show drastically different aerosols and envelope chemistry, and are intrinsically diverse beyond a simple temperature dependence."}

In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics."}

Exploration using a 3D dynamo model at different rotation rates", "comment": "9 pages, 10 figures, Accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "summary": "The Babcock-Leighton dynamo, which relies on the generation of a poloidal field through the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), is a promising paradigm for explaining the features of the solar magnetic cycle. In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes."}

We examine two acoustic wave (AW) modes with periods of 11 minutes (AW1) and 5.5 minutes (AW2) propagating from 100 to 320 km altitude using a radial molecular kinetics model. The wave-driven heating was reduced by 40-56% with cycle-averaged temperature gradient $\\langle dT/dr \\rangle$ decreasing from 9.4 K per scale height H0 to 5.6 K/H$_0$ for AW1 and from 4.4 K/H$_0$ to 1.9 K/H$_0$ for AW2 when accounting for planetary curvature. While the growth in wave density amplitude was attenuated for the 1D radial geometry as well, the heating differences are more pronounced, with both effects driven by geometric spreading accumulating as waves propagate into increasingly rarefied regions. These findings suggest that accounting for curvature effects is crucial when conducting DSMC estimates of acoustic wave contributions to thermospheric heating and atmospheric escape, as Cartesian-based derived counterparts may be overestimated by factors of 1.7-2.3 for these frequencies."}

Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available."}

Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (>75\\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of <1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z>3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy."}

While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2.

In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $δθ_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})(λ_{\\mathrm{GW}}/r) \\approx 2~\\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels. We argue, therefore, that a coherent analysis of PTA data, fully incorporating pulsar distance information, is timely."}

While single stars can swell following the chemical evolution of their interior, stars belonging to binary systems cannot overflow the size of the Roche lobe and hydrostatic equilibrium is strictly impossible. The system is forced to exchange mass between its members through the inner Lagrangian point. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the standard evolution of binaries that have a non-degenerate donor star and a compact companion. We show that the model fails when to account for the occurrence of binary pulsars when they predict a long-standing mass transfer episode. Models including irradiation feedback and evaporation in close binaries are examined next. Following these sections, we discuss the case of systems with a black hole (BH). We show that if BHs are born non-rotating, binary interaction seems insufficient to speed them up, an indication that BH rotation is a feature present at birth. Finally, we discuss Blue Straggler Stars detected in open and globular clusters. Since they cannot be understood as single-born stars, we evaluate one of the proposed channels is mass transfer in close binaries, and discuss its viability and the limitations of the present models."}

However, damage to the primary mirror due to micrometeoroid impacts will provide a stochastic, time-dependent source of stray light in the coronagraph's field of view that could significantly lengthen exposure times and reduce the expected science yield. To better quantify the impact of stray light and inform the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission design process, we present estimates of stray light in different micrometeoroid damage scenarios for a broad range of targets, and use that to find the expected decrease in science yield (i.e., the expected number of detected exoEarth candidates). We find that stray light due to micrometeoroid damage may significantly reduce yield, by 30% -- 60% in some cases, but significant uncertainties remain due to the unknown maximum expected impactor energy, and the relationship between impact energy and expected crater size. Micrometeoroid damage therefore needs further exploration, as it has the potential to reduce scientific yield, and in turn drive the development of mitigation strategies, selection of telescope designs, and selection of observing priorities in the future."}

Although argon is an $α-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $α-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\\odot}$ for the $\\langle z \\rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\\odot}$ for the $\\langle z \\rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon."}

While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars."}

We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\\rm HCO^+}=0.09\\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\\pm0.03$ and $0.05\\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\\pm0.1$ to $5.0\\pm0.1$ across the same transition.

For the subset of 81 broad Lya absorbers (BLAs; b(HI) > 45 km/s), we obtain a marginal $\\sim$3 $σ$ O VI detection. Other than Si III, detected at 5$σ$, no associated metal lines are found. Cross-correlation of the Lya absorbers with galaxies indicates that 93% of these absorbers are not associated with bright galaxies within 1 Mpc, implying that the detected O VI originates in the diffuse IGM rather than the circumgalactic medium. The stacked O VI signal suggests characteristic metallicities of $\\sim 0.01\\,Z_{\\odot}$ under photoionisation and $\\sim 0.001\\,Z_{\\odot}$ under collisional ionisation conditions, though these estimates are model-dependent and assume that O VI and H I trace the same phase. This study provides the first observational evidence for metal absorption in low-column-density Lya systems that individually exhibit no detectable metals, placing important constraints on the metal enrichment of the underdense IGM."}

To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\\sim$ 10 $\\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \\ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \\ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model.

The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc.

Exploration using a 3D dynamo model at different rotation rates", "comment": "9 pages, 10 figures, Accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "summary": "The Babcock-Leighton dynamo, which relies on the generation of a poloidal field through the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), is a promising paradigm for explaining the features of the solar magnetic cycle. In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes."}

We collected spectroscopic data using the Isaac Newton Telescope to analyze 18 nearby galaxies (strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred) drawn from Galaxy Zoo DESI. We obtained spatial profiles of equivalent width (EW) and ionized gas velocity dispersion by fitting Gaussian profiles to the Hα emission line. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit a distinctive three-peaked EW[Hα] structure, consistent with inward funneling of gas. Weakly barred systems lack this pattern, which suggests limited inflow. Velocity dispersion distributions further distinguish the bar types, with strongly barred galaxies showing significantly higher values than weakly barred and unbarred systems. These results suggest that strong bars drive gas inflow, while weak bars exert a limited dynamical influence."}

Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample.

However, damage to the primary mirror due to micrometeoroid impacts will provide a stochastic, time-dependent source of stray light in the coronagraph's field of view that could significantly lengthen exposure times and reduce the expected science yield. To better quantify the impact of stray light and inform the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission design process, we present estimates of stray light in different micrometeoroid damage scenarios for a broad range of targets, and use that to find the expected decrease in science yield (i.e., the expected number of detected exoEarth candidates). We find that stray light due to micrometeoroid damage may significantly reduce yield, by 30% -- 60% in some cases, but significant uncertainties remain due to the unknown maximum expected impactor energy, and the relationship between impact energy and expected crater size. Micrometeoroid damage therefore needs further exploration, as it has the potential to reduce scientific yield, and in turn drive the development of mitigation strategies, selection of telescope designs, and selection of observing priorities in the future."}

Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag.

While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems."}

Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies."}

By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas."}

Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%.

However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution."}

Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\\gtrsim0.6\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs."}

Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies."}

Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures."}

The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5\" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\\pm$ 1.0 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\\pm$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time."}

Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies."}

Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions."}
