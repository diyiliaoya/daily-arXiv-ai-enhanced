Semenov"], "title": "How Do Disk Galaxies Form?", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures; submitted to ApJ; comments are welcome", "summary": "In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks."}

We use von Mises-Fisher statistics to calculate the sample mean planes and mean plane uncertainties for the Hilda group and its Hilda, Schubart, and Potomac collisional subfamilies. Although Laplace-Lagrange linear secular theory is considered inapplicable within mean motion resonances, we find that the Laplace plane and the orbital plane of Jupiter are both statistically indistinguishable from the sample mean plane of the Hildas.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale ΛCDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6μ\\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth."}

We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly."}

On $\\gtrsim$10 AU scales, which can be resolved by the presented 873-3075 $μ$m observations, the ring is marginally optical thick at 873 $μ$m wavelength.

We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains.

Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario."}

In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses."}

In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications."}

Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs."}

Previous studies suggested that liquid water could exist on such moons under thick CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres, but these models faced challenges with CO$_2$ condensation and atmospheric collapse, particularly in the high-pressure regimes that favoured long-term habitability. To address this, we employ a self-consistent model, including radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry with condensation, to simulate a more stable hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for a range of initial chemical compositions, including C, O, and N. We find that such atmospheres can effectively trap heat via collision-induced absorption of H$_2$, maintaining surface temperatures suitable for liquid water for time-scales of up to 4.3 Gyr, depending on the surface pressure, while not prone to condensation-induced collapse. Wet-dry cycling caused by the strong tides together with the alkalinity of dissolved NH$_3$ could create favourable conditions for RNA polymerisation and thus support the emergence of life."}

While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code."}

Capturing these interactions is key to understanding the chemical evolution and present-day diversity of sub-Neptunes, super-Earths, and terrestrial planets, particularly in light of new JWST observations and upcoming missions. Recent advances in both geochemistry and astrophysics now allow the integration of experimental constraints and thermodynamic models across melt, metal, and gas phases. Here we extend a global chemical equilibrium model to include non-ideal behavior in all three phases. Our framework combines fugacity corrections for gas species with activity coefficients for silicate and metal species, enabling a fully coupled description of volatile partitioning. We show that for planetary embryos (0.5 M$_\\oplus$ at 2350 K), non-ideality introduces only modest corrections to atmosphere-magma ocean interface (AMOI) pressures, volatile inventories, and interior compositions. In contrast, for sub-Neptunes with higher temperatures ($\\approx$ 3000 K) and pressures, non-ideal effects are more pronounced, though still modest in absolute terms$-$typically within 20% and at most a factor of two. Including activity and fugacity coefficients simultaneously increases the AMOI pressure, enhances water retention in the mantle and the envelope. Our results demonstrate that non-ideality must be treated globally: applying corrections to only one phase leads to incomplete or even misleading trends. These findings highlight the importance of self-consistent global thermodynamic treatments for interpreting atmospheric spectra and interior structures of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths."}

Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios."}

Submitted to A&A. Comments welcome", "summary": "Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology remain challenging, particularly in low-data regimes, due to complex forward operators and the frequent lack of well-motivated priors for non-Gaussian signals. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes. Our approach opens the way to new applications for non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals for which little or no prior modeling is available."}

Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare.

Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space. This automatically removes the need for extra operations to recover the wide-field systematics error model without any discontinuity. We provide results based on LOFAR data where we compare the traditional facet-based (discrete directional gains) calibration with the proposed approach. The comparison shows improved image quality, mainly because of the physical plausibility of the proposed approach as opposed to using a piecewise constant model for direction-dependent systematic errors."}

The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($τ_{667μm}$ >0.5, corresponding to $N_H > 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at >500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $μ$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the \"greenhouse\" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $Σ_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $τ_{100 μm}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus."}

The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved.

In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses."}

To better understand the origin of the stellar substructures and constrain their past orbit, we model the past 2.5 Gyr of the interactions between the MW and the LMC and SMC using N-body simulations. Due to the strong interactions, analytical orbit integrations are insufficient to analyze the past galaxy orbits accurately. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm in combination with N-body simulations to determine the LMC and SMC initial positions and velocities 2.5 Gyr ago that result in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) arriving near their observed locations and velocities at the current time. After running ~8,000 simulations, our best matching model includes two close interactions between the MCs (940 Myr and 140 Myr ago) and reproduces some observed features of the MCs, including the LMC disc warp, a ring-shaped overdensity in the LMC, the tidal expansion of the SMC, and a greater distance dispersion on the eastern side of the SMC. The LMC disc warp is caused by the most recent interaction with the SMC, which occurred ~140 Myr before the present. The interaction causes global ripples in the LMC disc with a mean amplitude of 1.3 kpc."}

Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\\cal O}(Ω^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys."}

MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars.

The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways.\n  Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners & Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics.\n  Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology.\n  Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs.\n  Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs."}

Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30."}

In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \\lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions. The strategy of leveraging extended time baselines will be increasingly effective as spectroscopic databases continue to grow, enabling the systematic discovery of compact objects in wide orbits across the Galaxy."}

For the past $5-6~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc."}

Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds."}

We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation."}

Earlier such works were idealized in the sense that the static magnetic fields were imposed below the photosphere, i.e., the free-surface, to detect signatures of sub-surface magnetic fields and flows on the $f$-mode. In this work, we perform three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations where the interior fluid below the photosphere is stirred helically at small scales, thus facilitating an $α^2$-dynamo. This allows us to investigate how these self-consistently generated large-scale magnetic fields influence the properties of the $f$-mode. We find that when the magnetic fields saturate near the equipartition values with the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow, the $f$-mode is significantly perturbed. Compared to the non-magnetic case, or the kinematic phase of the dynamo when fields are too weak, we note that the frequencies and the strengths of the $f$-mode are enhanced in presence of saturated magnetic fields, with these effects being larger at larger wavenumbers. This qualitatively confirms the earlier findings from observational and numerical works which reported the $f$-mode strengthening due to strong sub-surface magnetic fields."}

MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars.

Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view).

The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs.

Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$α$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs."}

In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix.

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "Radio observations offer a dust-independent probe of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, but sufficiently deep data are required to access the crossover luminosity between these processes at high redshift ($z>4.5$). We present three spectroscopically confirmed high-redshift radio sources (HzRSs) detected at 1.3 GHz at $z=4.9$-$5.6$, with radio luminosities spanning $L_{\\rm 1.3 \\, GHz}\\approx2$-$5\\times10^{24} \\, \\rm W \\, Hz^{-1}$. These sources were first identified as high-redshift candidates through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival Hubble, JWST NIRCam+MIRI, and ground-based photometry, and then spectroscopically confirmed via the $\\rm H\\,α$ emission line using wide-field slitless spectroscopy from JWST COSMOS-3D. The star formation rates (SFRs) measured from SED fitting, the $\\rm H\\,α$ flux, and the 1.3 GHz luminosity, span $\\sim100$-$1800\\, M_{\\odot} \\, \\rm yr^{-1}$, demonstrating broad agreement between these SFR tracers. We find that these three sources lie either on or $0.5$-1.0 dex above the star-forming main sequence at $z=4$-6 and have undergone a recent burst of star formation. The sources have extended rest-UV/optical morphologies with no evidence for a dominant point source component, indicating that an AGN is unlikely to dominate their rest-UV and optical emission. Two of the sources have complex, multi-component rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, suggesting that their starbursts may be triggered by merging activity. These HzRSs open up a new window towards probing radio emission powered by star formation alone at $z> 4.5$, representing a remarkable opportunity to begin tracing star formation, independent of dust, in the early Universe."}

Main text: 19 pages, 9 figures. Data url will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "We present deep, medium-resolution $λ=1-5\\,μ$m JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 14 quiescent galaxies at $3<z<5$ with $\\log_{10}(M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}){\\,>\\,}10$, obtained as part of the EXCELS survey. We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral \"wiggles\" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological \"downsizing\" trend was already in place by $z\\simeq4$. The slope of our measured relation ($\\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at $0 < z < 3$. We do not observe objects with $\\log_{10}(M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})\\lesssim10.5$ and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 < z < 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $α$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $>100$ for $R\\simeq1000$)."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Winds launched at the scale of the accretion disc or dusty torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to drive energy-conserving outflows that shape galaxy evolution. The key signature of such outflows, the presence of a hot ($T \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, \\rm K$), shocked wind component, is hard to detect directly. Observations of AGN outflows typically probe a separate outflow phase: cool/warm gas with $T \\lesssim 10^5 \\, \\rm K$. Here, we show that the density of cool outflowing gas scales with AGN luminosity, serving as an indirect diagnostic of the elusive hot, shocked wind. We use hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to target the interaction between a small-scale AGN wind of speed $\\approx 10^4 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$ and galactic discs containing an idealised, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). Through a new refinement scheme targeting rapidly-cooling, fast-moving gas, our simulations reach a resolution of $\\lesssim 0.1 \\, \\rm pc$ in the cool, outflowing phase. We extract an ensemble of cool clouds from the AGN-driven outflows produced in our simulations, finding that their densities increase systematically with AGN wind power and AGN luminosity. Moreover, the mass distribution and internal properties of these cloudlets appear to be insensitive to the initial properties of the ISM, and shaped mainly by the dynamics of radiative, turbulent mixing layers. The increase in cool outflow density with kinetic wind power and AGN luminosity has profound implications for observational estimates of outflow rates and their scaling with AGN luminosity. Depending on the available outflow and density tracers, observationally-derived outflow rates may be overestimated by orders of magnitude."}

Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\\sim 1.4 \\, μ\\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \\sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \\lesssim 3000\\, \\mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\\sim2000\\, \\mathrm{K} - 4000 \\, \\mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas."}

In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses."}
