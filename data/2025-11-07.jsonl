The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary\nfrom the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of\nthe binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR)\nmay suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider\nrestricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a\ntest-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called\n\"limiting eccentricity\") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of\nthe tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high\nhierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show\nthat the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the\nsame limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the\nquadrupole-order Hamiltonian.

The surface free energy (SFE) of the\ndust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other\nafter collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which\nfragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate,\nsilica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary\ndust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures,\nand a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular\ndynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica,\nalbite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true\nvacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing\ntemperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More\ndramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of\nmagnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our\nresults confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of\nwater produces this reduction in SFE in experiments.

Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded\nstars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and\nchemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal\" stars that\nindefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and\n``metamorphic\" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching\nthe disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their\ncores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large\nmasses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal\"\ntrack unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in\npreventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of\norder-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate.

For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that\nbest matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to\nsimulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have.\nThese simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected\ngiven the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass -- halo mass\nrelationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster\n(GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to\nbetter constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that\nobserved UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a\nstriking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of\nobserved ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can\nproduce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive\nhalos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this\ntension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the\nmost likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different\ndark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This\nhighlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies\nof a stellar mass of $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the\nfull range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos."}

MHD turbulence can be\ndecomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfv\\'en-each\ncontributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing\nand separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the\nlimited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we\nuse 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode\nenergy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find\nthat the Alfv\\'en and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and\ntogether dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the\nfast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions,\nmultiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We\nfurther introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional\nResidual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic\ndata. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct\nmorphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing\nanisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of\nisothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions.

These PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts have been previously reported\nexperimentally due to the high reactivity between PAHs and C$_{60}$. From the\nastrophysical point of view, however, they have not been considered in detail\nyet. Here we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study in\norder to characterize the IR spectra of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, including\nmultiple adducts. By using new advanced experimental techniques, we have been\nable to synthesize some specific PAH-C$_{60}$ adduct isomers, and measured\ntheir IR spectra. These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic\nscaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at\nthe DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the\nIR ($\\sim$3$-$25 $\\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by\na different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the\nchemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively\nestimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these\nPAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our\nresults reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when\nastronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral\npeculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\\sim$3.4-3.6 $\\mu$m feature, and\nimportant modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\\mu$m spectral regions together\nwith contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\\mu$m.\nInterestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they\ndisplay IR features around 3.4 $\\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of\nthis astronomical feature."}

Proceedings of the 16th European VLBI Network\n  Symposium (EVN 2024, Bonn, Germany)", "summary": "Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides high angular resolution\nimages and has been used for stellar astrometry for decades. The DYNAMO-VLBA\nproject utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and\nmultiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio\nemission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems\ncannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of\ntheir orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass.\nHere, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the\nS1 system in Ophiuchus and EC\\,95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and\nmassive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find\nthat the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \\pm 0.10\\,M_{\\odot}$. This\nis significantly less than the value of $\\sim6\\,M_{\\odot}$ expected from\ntheoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary,\nS1B, has a mass of $0.831 \\pm 0.014\\,M_{\\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri\nstar. In the Serpens triple system EC\\,95, we measure the masses of EC\\,95A and\nEC\\,95B, finding $2.15\\pm0.10$ M$_\\odot$ and $2.00\\pm0.12$ M$_\\odot$,\nrespectively. In this case, the measured masses agree with the location of the\nstars in the HR diagram for very young 2 $M_\\odot$ stars.

We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and\ndecaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion\nwhich limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as\nwind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded\nstars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and\nchemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal\" stars that\nindefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and\n``metamorphic\" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching\nthe disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their\ncores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large\nmasses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal\"\ntrack unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in\npreventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of\norder-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars\nsignificantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\\alpha$-elements, potentially\nexplaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without\nexcessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay\nbetween stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar\npopulations and chemical evolution within AGN disks."}

The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary\nfrom the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of\nthe binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR)\nmay suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider\nrestricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a\ntest-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called\n\"limiting eccentricity\") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of\nthe tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high\nhierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show\nthat the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the\nsame limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the\nquadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks\ndown and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction\nterm; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we\nemploy the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity\nin the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical\nscaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model."}

Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal\ntracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We aim to increase the\nnumber of available DCEPS with high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities, to\nstudy the galactocentric radial gradients of several chemical elements and\nanalyse the spatial distribution of the Galactic young population of stars in\nthe Milky Way disc. We performed a complete spectroscopical analysis of 136\nspectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a\ntotal of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days,\nup to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P>15d. We\nderived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances up to\n33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines\nfor the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set\nto revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL\nsurvey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first\ntime (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for\nDysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium\nabundances. We calculate a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of\n$-0.064\\pm0.002$, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The\nother elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect\ndiminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements.\nDepending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature\nsources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the\nNorma-Outer or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus (OSC)\narms."}

We\nhave employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V)\nfilters.

The primary\nfocus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host\nstar using the transit method. The application of different filters was\nexpected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as\nthe exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's\nsize appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V\nfilter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to\ndetermine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the\norbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration\n(measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results\nindicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than\nthose with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes,\nrespectively.
