The program GCs cover the metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-2.35 dex to [Fe/H]=-0.74 dex. Both the halo and disc GCs show a clear overabundance of alpha-elements with the modulation in Mg and Si due to the MPs phenomenon in different clusters. We found star to star variations in Si abundance correlated to changes in Na in more than half of our sample, implying that temperatures in excess of about 65 MK were achieved in the polluters responsible for the enrichment. We confirm with an enlarged sample the previous result that significant variations in Mg are observed in GCs that are metal-poor, massive or both. Evidence of excess of Ca with respect to reference unpolluted field stars are found in NGC 6752 and NGC 7078, indicating the action of proton-capture reactions at very high temperature regime in these GCs. These excesses fit very well in a previously found relation as a function of a combination of cluster mass and metallicity shown by other typical signatures of MPs. At odds with previous results based on the Si abundance from APOGEE, we found that the average abundance of alpha-elements is not an efficient discriminating factor between in situ and accreted GCs."}

For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed."}

This survey targeted 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc to search for mid-infrared excesses, flux deficits from collision-induced absorption, and resolved substellar companions. In this paper we present our analysis of WD 0644+025, an unusually massive white dwarf (0.95 Msun) and the MEAD target exhibiting the most significant mid-infrared excess. The observed JWST MIRI photometry shows a 7.3 sigma excess at 15 microns and a 3.6 sigma excess at 10 microns, which may be associated with either a planetary companion or a circumstellar dust disk. This excess corresponds to a companion mass of 6.8 Mjup (Teff=261 +/- 9 K) with orbital distance <11.8 au, although substantially lower masses are possible if we consider a closely orbiting insolated companion. No spatially resolved sources are detected within 200 au, with contrast curve analysis excluding planets more massive than 2 Mjup beyond ~12 au. Metal pollution is confirmed in both archival Keck HIRES spectra from 1999 and new observations from 2025, with no evidence suggesting the accretion rate has substantially changed over the decades. We explore possible dust disk morphologies to describe the observed IR excess, and find that traditional debris disks struggle to fit our data. WD 0644+025 thus represents a compelling case study in the growing population of white dwarfs with cold infrared excesses, and highlights JWST's ability to probe planetary system remnants inaccessible to prior infrared observatories."}

Our analysis focuses on a uniform sample of 142 age-benchmark brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects spanning late-M, L, and T spectral types, with independently determined ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr. We perform forward-model spectral fitting for all benchmarks' IRTF/SpeX spectra ($R\\sim$80-250) using both SM08 and Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models to infer effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and cloud sedimentation efficiencies. The two model grids yield broadly consistent results. Among L4-L9 dwarfs, we identify a statistically significant, population-level age dependence of the cloud parameter $f_{\\rm sed}$, with young benchmarks ($<300$ Myr) exhibiting systematically lower $f_{\\rm sed}$ values than older counterparts. This trend is absent across L0-T5 and T0-T5, demonstrating that cloud properties vary with age and surface gravity and offering explanations for the observed gravity-dependent photometric properties at the late-L end of the L/T transition. By comparing spectroscopically inferred parameters with predictions from evolution models, we quantify systematic errors in the fitted atmospheric parameters and establish empirical calibrations to anchor future studies using these atmospheric models. Stacked residuals of the sample reveal wavelength-dependent data-model mismatches associated with key atomic and molecular absorption bands, highlighting the need for improved opacities and rainout chemistry. Finally, we show that including an interstellar-medium-like extinction term significantly improves the spectral fits, confirming and broadening previous findings and suggesting missing opacity sources in current cloudy models."}

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures."}

These assumptions have not been systematically tested. We assessed the accuracy of standard treatments of average polarisation profiles in M dwarfs and their interpretation with ZDI. We focused on the filling-factor approach, which attempts to represent coexisting global and small-scale fields. We performed polarised radiative transfer calculations across the near-infrared spectrum of a typical M dwarf. From these theoretical spectra, we derived mean Stokes profiles and approximated them with different line-synthesis methods. To test the recovery of global fields, we performed ZDI inversions using simulated Stokes V observations for low- and high-activity cases. The analytical approximation of mean polarisation profiles reproduces Stokes I and V only for fields up to ~1 kG and fails for linear polarisation. ZDI with single-line analytical Stokes V profiles is adequate for weakly magnetic M dwarfs with fields below a few hundred gauss. However, combined with the filling-factor formalism, this traditional modelling approach produces unphysical local fields and distorted global geometries for active M dwarfs with multi-kilogauss fields. These issues are mitigated using a new mapping technique based on theoretical Stokes profiles that account for both global and randomly distributed small-scale fields. Our study reveals fundamental limitations of current ZDI analyses of active M dwarfs and questions the reliability of some published maps. (abridged)"}

Bars redistribute angular momentum across the galaxy, regulating star formation, AGN activity, and building new stellar structures such as nuclear discs. However, the effects of bar-driven evolution on young galaxies are not yet known, as no evidence of bar-built stellar structures has ever been found beyond $z = 1$, until now. In this work, we show evidence of a bar-built, star-forming nuclear disc, already present at redshift $z = 1.5$. This is the first evidence of a bar-built stellar structure at Cosmic Noon. We find that this nuclear disc is actively forming stars and has the same size as some nuclear discs in nearby galaxies. This evidence solidifies the now emerging picture in which bars are fundamental not only in the late evolution of galaxies, but also in their early evolutionary stages. It changes the current paradigm by urging a revision of our picture of galaxy evolution beyond redshift one, to include new considerations on the role played by bars as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang."}

We recover the previously-detected rise in occurrence with semimajor axis for both lower- and higher-mass subsets of the population out to $\\sim$5 au. When restricting to planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 4.5 au (roughly speaking, the \"peak\" of giant planet occurrence), we find evidence for distinct eccentricity distributions for each of two mass sub-populations. Most strikingly, we observe a peak in the eccentricity distribution of super-Jovian planets (3-20~M$_{\\rm J}$) at 0.3, which is apparent using two different parameterizations of the eccentricity distribution model. A hierarchical histogram model reveals that $\\sim$92% of posterior samples indicate an elevated occurrence rate of super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities (0.2-0.4) compared to lower or higher eccentricities (i.e. evidence for a moderate eccentricity \"peak\"), and 99% of samples indicate super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities are more common than those with lower eccentricities (i.e. evidence that moderate eccentricities are more common than low eccentricities). We use a truncated Gaussian model fit to pinpoint the location of the super-Jupiter eccentricity peak with more precision, finding a maximum a posterior (MAP) peak location of $e=0.3$.

Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.\n  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.\n  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems."}

Aims: We aim to understand the origins of the Necklace and its dwarf carbon central star. Methods: We study the carbon abundance of the nebula through far ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Furthermore, through simultaneous modelling of multiband light and velocity curves, we attempt to constrain the parameters of the central star system. Results: Puzzlingly, we find that the region of the inner nebula observed with the Hubble Space Telescope is seemingly not carbon-rich, at odds with the dwarf carbon star nature of the companion of the central star. The initial mass of the nebular progenitor was likely very close to the limit to become carbon-rich, perhaps experiencing a very late thermal pulse. The dwarf carbon star companion is found to be significantly inflated with respect to that expected for an isolated main sequence star of the same mass. Conclusions: The properties of the central binary are consistent with the progenitor having become carbon-rich and its companion having accreted a significant amount of that carbon-enriched material. However, it is unclear how this evolutionary hypothesis can be reconciled with the inner nebula potentially being carbon poor."}

We use stellar surface abundances from the $\\textit{APOGEE}$ survey combined with kinematic data from the $\\textit{Gaia}$ mission.

Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as switchbacks, rather than plasma inhomogeneities along the beam path. Using simulations and remote observations of 24 interplanetary type III bursts observed by Parker Solar Probe, we relate measured drift-rate variations to local field deflections. In 50% of events, we identify disturbances above a $2σ$ noise level that can be attributed to perpendicular deflections of the field between (0.7-1.7) R$_\\odot$, over scales (1.8-6.4) R$_\\odot$ at heliocentric distances (9-30) R$_\\odot$. The features correspond to either density changes of (10-30)%, or deflections of the field direction by (23-88)$^\\circ$. Further, beam transport simulations show field direction perturbations produce additional observational signatures in type III bursts: delayed emission, intensity breaks, and enhanced emission resembling stria fine structures. In addition, we identified four bursts where the observed variations are more plausibly explained by field deflections, possibly in the form of magnetic switchbacks, than by unrealistically large density changes along the field line. The results show that variations in type III burst profiles can arise from magnetic as well as density fluctuations, and demonstrate the value of type III bursts as remote probes of inner-heliospheric structure at kilometric wavelengths."}

We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($σ$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $σ$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\\sim$2 and $\\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $σ$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z>3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $σ$ and $v/σ$ as well as the dependence of $σ$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling. Our work provides the end-to-end framework needed to compare NIRSpec MSA observations to cosmological simulations and to quantify observational biases in measuring ionised gas kinematics, highlighting the need for the development of dedicated models for high-redshift galaxies."}

It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities."}

The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats."}

A comparison with existing literature periods reveals generally good agreement, although several stars exhibit discrepant or previously unrecognized behavior. Notably, six targets display clear multiperiodicity, which, when combined with archival TESS data, suggests that these six candidates are likely misclassified, for example, as a magnetic CP2 or a CP4 star and instead exhibit characteristics consistent with a Be/shell star. Furthermore, eleven stars show no detectable periodic variations within the precision limits of BRITE. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of long-term nanosatellite photometry, particularly when complemented by TESS data, in verifying catalogue periods, identifying multiperiodic behavior, and detecting potential misclassifications among bright CP stars."}

While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St<=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St<=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems."}

While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations."}

Our analysis focuses on a uniform sample of 142 age-benchmark brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects spanning late-M, L, and T spectral types, with independently determined ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr. We perform forward-model spectral fitting for all benchmarks' IRTF/SpeX spectra ($R\\sim$80-250) using both SM08 and Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models to infer effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and cloud sedimentation efficiencies. The two model grids yield broadly consistent results. Among L4-L9 dwarfs, we identify a statistically significant, population-level age dependence of the cloud parameter $f_{\\rm sed}$, with young benchmarks ($<300$ Myr) exhibiting systematically lower $f_{\\rm sed}$ values than older counterparts. This trend is absent across L0-T5 and T0-T5, demonstrating that cloud properties vary with age and surface gravity and offering explanations for the observed gravity-dependent photometric properties at the late-L end of the L/T transition. By comparing spectroscopically inferred parameters with predictions from evolution models, we quantify systematic errors in the fitted atmospheric parameters and establish empirical calibrations to anchor future studies using these atmospheric models. Stacked residuals of the sample reveal wavelength-dependent data-model mismatches associated with key atomic and molecular absorption bands, highlighting the need for improved opacities and rainout chemistry. Finally, we show that including an interstellar-medium-like extinction term significantly improves the spectral fits, confirming and broadening previous findings and suggesting missing opacity sources in current cloudy models."}

While there have been claims of the existence of at least one more significant merger before this time, supporting evidence has been indirect and contentious. Here we show that the population of globular clusters around the Galaxy depicts three distinct age-metallicity sequences, one associated with the merger with Gaia-Enceladus 10 billion years ago, one to the progenitor of the Milky Way and a third intermediate sequence associated to at least one merger which we estimate took place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. This discovery has been possible thanks to exquisite Hubble Space Telescope data and sophisticated analysis that enables very precise relative age determination of globular clusters. The newly identified sequence reveals that this merger took place with an object of stellar mass similar to that of Gaia-Enceladus (~5x10$^8$ M$_{\\odot}$), and which deposited most of its mass in the inner 6 kpc of the Milky Way. The unambiguous identification of a third merger event in the inner Galaxy puts to rest earlier debates, and honoring previous work we name the progenitor system Low-energy-Kraken-Heracles, or LKH for short."}

It is among the largest NEAs observable at such proximity, prompting an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) rapidresponse campaign. Although early orbital solutions indicated a possible impact in 2089, further follow-up astrometric observations ruled out collision hazard. The favourable geometry of this close encounter enabled a dense coverage of the positive part of the phasepolarisation curve, from the high polarisation domain (high phase angles), nearly to the inversion angle where the linear polarisation rate vanishes. The spectropolarimetric observations provided the wavelength dependence of the polarisation rate. Using empirical relationships, an estimate of the geometric albedo could be drawn from the slope of the phase-polarisation curve at inversion angle. Moreover, the spectropolarimetric trends yielded constraints on the taxonomic class. These results demonstrate the interest of polarimetry and spectropolarimetry for rapid characterisation of newly discovered NEAs in planetary defence campaigns."}

The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats."}

In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations."}

We recover the trend of increasing ex-situ stellar fraction with stellar mass and more spherical morphology, but we also identify a discrepancy between TNG and HSC: on average, observed galaxies generally exhibit lower ex-situ fractions. Despite challenges such as information loss (e.g. projection effects and surface brightness limits) and domain shifts (from simulations to observations), our results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting the merger past of galaxies from their optical images."}

Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.\n  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.\n  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems."}

It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities."}

This survey targeted 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc to search for mid-infrared excesses, flux deficits from collision-induced absorption, and resolved substellar companions. In this paper we present our analysis of WD 0644+025, an unusually massive white dwarf (0.95 Msun) and the MEAD target exhibiting the most significant mid-infrared excess. The observed JWST MIRI photometry shows a 7.3 sigma excess at 15 microns and a 3.6 sigma excess at 10 microns, which may be associated with either a planetary companion or a circumstellar dust disk. This excess corresponds to a companion mass of 6.8 Mjup (Teff=261 +/- 9 K) with orbital distance <11.8 au, although substantially lower masses are possible if we consider a closely orbiting insolated companion. No spatially resolved sources are detected within 200 au, with contrast curve analysis excluding planets more massive than 2 Mjup beyond ~12 au. Metal pollution is confirmed in both archival Keck HIRES spectra from 1999 and new observations from 2025, with no evidence suggesting the accretion rate has substantially changed over the decades. We explore possible dust disk morphologies to describe the observed IR excess, and find that traditional debris disks struggle to fit our data. WD 0644+025 thus represents a compelling case study in the growing population of white dwarfs with cold infrared excesses, and highlights JWST's ability to probe planetary system remnants inaccessible to prior infrared observatories."}

A sample of ~53,000 stars was selected as metal-poor on the basis of both their halo-like orbits and their spectroscopic [Fe/H] from Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. These metallicity estimates for low-mass stars were enabled by calibrating Gaia XP spectra with stellar parameters from SDSS-V. For -1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1, we find that the MF below 0.5 M_sun exhibits a \"bottom-heavy\" power-law slope of alpha ~ -1.6. We tentatively find that at even lower metallicities, the MF becomes very bottom-light, with a near-flat power-law slope of alpha ~ 0 that implies a severe deficit of low-mass stars. This metallicity-dependent variation is insensitive to the adopted stellar evolution model. These results show that the Galactic low-mass MF is not universal, with variations in the metal-poor regime. A further calibration of XP metallicities in the regime of M < 0.5 M_sun and [Fe/H] < -1.5 will be essential to verify these tentative low-metallicity trends."}

We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters. This extended atlas provides an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of the Milky Way.

We do a complete census of filaments in Cygnus X and quantify their links to dense cores, the magnetic field (B field), and HII regions. Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host > 93% of high-mass cores (>= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (> 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion. The B field likely regulates filament formation, consistent with the type-O mode (converging flows along an oblique MHD shock) and an HII-driven bubble-filament paradigm for Cygnus X."}

Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$α$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies.

Stars in this region are identified as recently formed C-stars that have not yet accumulated large amounts of carbon. Typically, 2--3 $M_\\odot$ stars remain longer in the J region, while lower-mass stars evolve faster. The JLF of the LMC, peaked at the expected magnitudes for these stars, confirms this picture. In the SMC, the J flux distribution is shifted to higher magnitudes, indicating an older population with lower-mass progenitors."}

The identifications were made using a hybrid method that combines deep learning with ridgeline flux density distribution analysis. Among these sources, 845 are new discoveries. The catalog comprises sources characterized by edge-darkened double jets, an absence of significant bent morphology, and angular sizes ranging from 23 to 159 arcseconds. Optical and/or infrared counterparts have been identified for 813 FR-Is. Among these, the host galaxies are predominantly (88.1\\%) red galaxies, with the remainder (11.9\\%) being blue galaxies; notably, most blue galaxies exhibit high radio power. The FR-I sample spans a radio power range of $1.20 \\times 10^{21} \\leq P_{\\rm 1400} \\leq 3.55 \\times 10^{27} \\, {\\rm W\\,Hz}^{-1}$ at 1400 MHz and reaches redshifts up to $z = 2.307$. The host galaxies have $r$-band absolute magnitudes in the range $-24 \\lesssim M_r \\lesssim -20$ mag.

Based on optical emission-line ratios and mid-infrared colors, spectroscopic classification shows that 571 hosts are low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 59 are high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs)."}

By significantly expanding the area covered by the original VVV survey, VVVX enables a deeper and broader exploration of the most obscured and crowded regions of the Milky Way. We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters. This extended atlas provides an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of the Milky Way. It is now publicly available through the VISTA Science Archive, offering a valuable resource for the astronomical community to investigate the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk and bulge."}

The abstract has been modified to comply with the astro-ph length requirement", "summary": "Aims. We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$α$ surface brightness ($Σ$(H$α$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $Σ$(H$α$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$α$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $Σ$(H$α$) bins reach $\\sim$0.4 dex and $\\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $Σ$(H$α$), metallicity, EW(H$α$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks."}

The molecular gas forms a regularly rotating circumnuclear disk aligned with the prominent dust lane seen in HST imaging. We model the full three-dimensional ALMA data cube using the KinMS forward-modeling framework, exploring both data-driven and analytic prescriptions for the gas surface brightness distribution.

The inferred black hole mass is fully consistent across different modeling assumptions and remains insensitive to plausible radial variations in the $M/L_{\\rm F814W}$ profile. Our results resolve the long-standing discrepancy between previous indirect mass estimates based on conflicting stellar velocity dispersion measurements and demonstrate that the exceptionally large dispersion reported in the literature is likely spurious. This study highlights the power of high-resolution ALMA molecular gas kinematics for precision SMBH mass measurements at the high-mass end of the local black hole mass function."}

They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence."}

Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity.

The program GCs cover the metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-2.35 dex to [Fe/H]=-0.74 dex. Both the halo and disc GCs show a clear overabundance of alpha-elements with the modulation in Mg and Si due to the MPs phenomenon in different clusters. We found star to star variations in Si abundance correlated to changes in Na in more than half of our sample, implying that temperatures in excess of about 65 MK were achieved in the polluters responsible for the enrichment. We confirm with an enlarged sample the previous result that significant variations in Mg are observed in GCs that are metal-poor, massive or both. Evidence of excess of Ca with respect to reference unpolluted field stars are found in NGC 6752 and NGC 7078, indicating the action of proton-capture reactions at very high temperature regime in these GCs. These excesses fit very well in a previously found relation as a function of a combination of cluster mass and metallicity shown by other typical signatures of MPs. At odds with previous results based on the Si abundance from APOGEE, we found that the average abundance of alpha-elements is not an efficient discriminating factor between in situ and accreted GCs."}

For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed."}
