*Si-Rui Ge,Nikko J. Cleri,Joel Leja,Antonello Calabro,Vital Fernandez*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本研究使用JWST/NIRSpec中红外光谱数据，通过近红外发射线诊断来识别星系中的电离源，发现近红外诊断比光学诊断更能抵抗尘埃衰减的影响，识别出了被尘埃遮蔽的AGN和恒星形成活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学发射线诊断在尘埃衰减严重的星系中容易导致电离源分类错误，需要开发更稳健的长波长诊断方法来准确识别被尘埃遮蔽的电离源。

Method: 使用JWST/NIRSpec MSA中分辨率光谱数据，分析55个z<3星系的近红外发射线比率（[S III] 9530、[Fe II] 12566、[Fe II] 16443与帕邢线之比）来诊断电离源。

Result: 90%的样本在不同波长下分类一致，其余不一致的源可归因于尘埃遮蔽的电离辐射和/或升高的N/Fe丰度。识别出3个光学分类为恒星形成但近红外分类为AGN的被遮蔽AGN，以及3个光学分类为AGN但近红外分类为恒星形成的源。

Conclusion: 近红外发射线诊断是识别被尘埃遮蔽电离源的有效工具，未来需要空间分辨和/或中红外光谱来进一步验证这些不一致源中AGN和恒星对电离光子预算的相对贡献。

Abstract: Rest-frame optical emission line diagnostics are often used to help classify ionizing sources within galaxies. However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z < 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources.

### [2] [Where Giants Dwell: Probing the Environments of Early Massive Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08674)
*Gabriella De Lucia,Lizhi Xie,Michaela Hirschmann,Fabio Fontanot*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 该研究使用GAEA理论模型分析3<z<5红移范围内大质量静止星系的环境特征，发现这些星系形成时间范围广，具有α元素增强特征，分布在从空洞到密集节点等多种环境中，其演化路径具有随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究早期大质量静止星系的环境特征，以理解它们的形成机制和演化路径，挑战传统认为这些系统都是现今最密集星系团前身体的假设。

Method: 使用GAEA星系演化理论模型，选择恒星质量约10^10.8太阳质量、特定恒星形成率低于0.3倍哈勃时间的星系，在约685Mpc模拟体积中获得约5000个星系样本。

Result: 模型显示高红移静止星系具有α元素增强和宽范围恒星金属丰度；它们分布在从空洞到密集节点的多种环境中；约三分之一系统保持永久静止，多数复苏事件由并合驱动且在过密区域更常见。

Conclusion: 早期静止星系具有多样性，不应假设所有此类系统都是现今最密集星系团的前身，其演化路径受并合随机性影响显著。

Abstract: We investigate the environments of massive quiescent galaxies at 3 < z < 5 using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) theoretical model. We select galaxies with stellar mass ~10^10.8 Msun and specific star formation rate below 0.3x t_Hubble, yielding in a sample of about 5,000 galaxies within a simulated volume of ~685 Mpc. These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters.

### [3] [Evidence for in-situ acceleration of relativistic particles in the wings of X-shaped radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08676)
*Dusmanta Patra,Gopal-Krishna,Ravi Joshi*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 研究发现68个X形射电星系中有11个存在相对论性粒子的原位加速/再加速证据，这通过射电瓣进入翼部时谱指数剖面停止变陡甚至变平的现象来证实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究X形射电星系中粒子加速机制，特别是验证射电瓣等离子体流弯曲连接翼部时是否发生原位粒子加速。

Method: 结合LoTSS-DR2（144 MHz）和FIRST（1.4 GHz）射电观测数据，分析40个X形射电星系中68个翼部的谱指数剖面变化趋势。

Result: 在11个射电翼中观察到谱指数剖面停止变陡或变平的现象，表明存在原位粒子加速，且这种现象主要发生在射电瓣弯曲连接翼部的区域。

Conclusion: 研究提供了大量关于射电星系瓣中发生原位粒子加速的证据，这一发现将推动对这一重要现象的后续观测、理论和数值模拟研究。

Abstract: We report evidence for in-situ acceleration/re-acceleration of relativistic particles in 11 radio wings out of a total of 68 wings sufficiently well-resolved for spectral mapping, which belong to our sample of 40 X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs). This representative XRG sample includes 15 XRGs newly reported here, which we selected from the LOTSS-DR2 survey, following well-defined criteria. The evidence for in-situ particle acceleration comes from the observed cessation of steepening, or even flattening (i.e., gradient reversal) of the spectral index profile along the lobe into the associated wing, as determined here by combining the LoTSS-DR2 (144 MHz) and FIRST (1.4 GHz) maps. Interestingly, the afore-mentioned trends in spectral gradient, indicative of in-situ particle acceleration, are mostly found to set in near the region where the lobe plasma stream bends to connect to the wing. Such a spatial coincidence with bending of radio lobe/tail has been noticed in recent years for just a couple of radio galaxies. The large increase in such examples, as reported here, is expected to give a fillip to observational, theoretical and numerical simulation follow-up investigations of this important clue about the occurrence of in-situ particle acceleration in lobes of radio galaxies.

### [4] [Highly Efficient Identification of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies in the Local Universe: >8000 New Green Pea Candidates at 0.12 < z < 0.36](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08678)
*Heather Samonski,Samir Salim,John Salzer*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SED匹配的方法，在不依赖光谱信息的情况下识别绿色豌豆星系，将候选样本数量增加了10倍，达到约9600个，并发现了新的"扩展豌豆"类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SDSS中绿色豌豆星系因主要来自偶然光谱目标而数量稀少的问题，通过开发不依赖光谱的识别方法来发现更多候选星系，以便更好地表征其高红移类似物和莱曼连续谱逃逸。

Method: 引入SED匹配方法，利用SDSS和WISE测光数据，基于光谱确认的恒星、类星体和星系来分离候选绿色豌豆星系与污染物，该方法有效率为85%，污染率约为10%。

Result: 识别出约9600个绿色豌豆星系候选体，分布在0.12<z<0.36红移范围内，其中1200个预测具有超过500埃的[OIII]5007等效宽度，并发现了"扩展豌豆"这一新类型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功大幅扩展了绿色豌豆星系的候选样本，为研究其高红移类似物和莱曼连续谱逃逸提供了更好的统计基础，并揭示了新的星系类型。

Abstract: The currently known compact extreme emission-line galaxies (the "Green Peas", GPs) in SDSS are rare and were mostly found among serendipitous spectroscopic targets, thus leaving open the possibility that a substantial population of GPs is missed. A significantly larger number of identified GPs in the Local Universe might provide a better characterization of their high-redshift analogs and Lyman continuum escape. In this paper, we confront the challenges of robustly identifying GPs without spectroscopic information, a needed approach considering the incompleteness of spectroscopic surveys for compact sources. The principal difficulty stems from a significant contamination of photometric candidates by stars and quasars of similar color. To solve this, we introduce an SED matching method, which separates candidate GPs from contaminants on the basis of SDSS and WISE photometry of spectroscopically confirmed stars, quasars and galaxies. The method has an effectiveness of 85%, and a contamination rate of ~10%. With it we identify ~9600 GP candidates expected to lie in the 0.12 < z < 0.36 range - a tenfold increase over what would be selected using SDSS DR18 spectra. Some of the new GPs are as bright as r~19, and 1200 are predicted to have [OIII]5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 A. The new population contains many "Extended Peas", which are absent among known GPs and possibly represent merging systems. We provide catalogs containing 8313 newly identified GP candidates, as well as 917 GPs confirmed using SDSS spectroscopy and 521 GPs with spectroscopic redshifts from LAMOST and other sources.

### [5] [Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim~1$ and their connection with dark matter halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685)
*Pavel E. Mancera Piña,Enrico M. Di Teodoro,S. Michael Fall,Antonino Marasco,Mariska Kriek,Marco Martorano*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 该研究使用43个红移z=0.9的主序盘星系，结合Hα IFU数据和JWST/HST成像，推导了Tully-Fisher关系（M*-Vcirc,f）和Fall关系（j*-M*），发现与z=0相比，TFR有适度演化，FR有强烈演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高红移星系的基本标度关系演化，特别是Tully-Fisher关系和Fall关系，以了解星系形成和演化过程。

Method: 使用先进的3D运动学模型推断星系旋转曲线，结合近红外波段形态建模，以及应用SED建模到测光数据来估计恒星质量。对Hα速度进行不对称漂移校正。

Result: 得到TFR关系：log(M*/M⊙) = 3.82 log(Vcirc,f/150 km/s) + 10.27；FR关系：log(j*/kpc km/s) = 0.44 log(M*/10^10.5 M⊙) + 2.86。发现fM和fj在z=0.9时更高且质量依赖性更弱。

Conclusion: 星系到晕的标度参数fM和fj在z=0.9时更高，演化可能由更有效的恒星反馈或显著的干并合历史驱动。需要引入前身偏置场景或考虑Hα运动学作为动力学示踪剂的可靠性问题。

Abstract: We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$α$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$α$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$.
  When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$α$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.

*Brandon Pries,John H. Wise*

TL;DR: 使用支持向量机(SVM)识别早期宇宙中可能形成直接坍缩黑洞(DCBH)的暗晕，通过特征选择和超参数优化提高模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超大质量黑洞的起源机制尚不明确，直接坍缩黑洞(DCBH)是可能的形成途径之一，需要有效的方法来识别可能形成DCBH的暗晕。

Method: 采用支持向量机(SVM)分类器，通过选择关键特征子集和优化SVM超参数来提高模型识别能力。

Result: 最佳模型需要与恒星形成相关的参数，包括金属丰度、莱曼-维尔纳辐射通量和暗晕恒星质量。

Conclusion: 开发的SVM模型可作为宇宙学模拟中DCBH形成的概率性和整体性种子处方。

Abstract: The nature of the origins of supermassive black holes remains uncertain. Multiple possible seeding pathways have been proposed across a variety of mass scales, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One such channel is a direct collapse black hole (DCBH), thought to form from the deaths of supermassive stars in pristine atomic cooling halos in the early universe. In this work, we investigate the ability to identify halos likely to form a DCBH based on their properties using a support vector machine (SVM). We implement multiple methods to improve the accuracy of the model, including selecting subsets of critical features and optimizing SVM hyperparameters. We find that our best model requires quantities relevant to star formation, such as the metallicity, incident flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, and halo stellar mass. The SVMs produced from this work can serve as probabilistic and holistic seeding prescriptions for DCBHs in cosmological simulations.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: ALMA对6个邻近双极/束腰行星状星云进行1.3毫米分子线测绘，揭示了分子质量分布、组成和速度场，发现大部分分子气体追踪膨胀的赤道环面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双极行星状星云中分子气体的分布和演化，特别是赤道环面的形成机制及其与双极瓣形成的时间关系。

Method: 使用ALMA 1.3毫米波段对NGC 6302、Hubble 5等6个行星状星云进行分子线测绘，包括12CO(2-1)、13CO(2-1)以及HCN、HNC等多种分子发射线。

Result: 发现分子气体主要形成膨胀的赤道环面，膨胀速度15-50 km/s，分子质量0.002-0.1 M⊙，环面动力学年龄从500年到11000年不等。

Conclusion: 分子环面喷射先于双极瓣形成，这些结果为了解来自相对大质量前身星的双极行星状星云在约10 kyr后AGB演化期间的结构快速演化提供了见解。

Abstract: We present results from a program of Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm (Band 6) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, bipolar/pinched-waist, molecule-rich PNe (NGC 6302, Hubble 5, NGC 2440, NGC 6445, NGC 2899, and NGC 2818). Maps of $^{12}$CO(2$-$1) and $^{13}$CO(2$-$1) emission as well as emission lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, CN, and CS $-$ many of these detected in these PNe for the first time $-$ reveal the molecular mass distributions, compositions, and velocity fields of the equatorial and, in some cases, polar regions of the sample PNe. In each case, the bulk of the molecular gas traces an expanding equatorial torus, with torus expansion velocities ranging from $\sim$15 to $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ and molecular masses from $\sim$0.002 to $\sim$0.1 $M_\odot$. The inferred molecular torus dynamical ages, which span the range $\sim$500 yr (Hb 5) to $\sim$11000 yr (NGC 2818), provide support for a model wherein molecular torus ejection precedes bipolar lobe formation. Collectively, these ALMA survey results provide insight into the rapid structural evolution as well as the zones of irradiated molecular gas within bipolar PNe that are descended from relatively massive progenitors, likely residing in interacting binary systems, over $\sim$10 kyr of the post-AGB evolution of such systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了超阿尔芬湍流中偏振角结构函数D^φ(R)的谱斜率变化，建立了分析框架解释这种变化，并通过数值模拟验证了预测，使D^φ(R)成为诊断超阿尔芬湍流和获取M_A的有效工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超阿尔芬湍流在星系团和分子云等天体物理环境中广泛存在，但现有研究表明偏振角结构函数的谱斜率与底层磁场波动不同，限制了其在场强估计中的应用。

Method: 建立了分析框架解释D^φ(R)谱斜率在超阿尔芬湍流中的变化，并通过数值模拟验证预测，同时探索了偏振度结构函数和偏振方向谱。

Result: 研究表明在超阿尔芬湍流中，结构函数D^φ(R)随着M_A的增加而变浅，使其成为诊断超阿尔芬湍流和获取M_A的有价值工具。

Conclusion: 该研究使D^φ(R)成为超阿尔芬湍流的有效诊断工具，为从观测中获取M_A开辟了新途径，对星系团和星际介质中的湍流和磁场研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: MHD turbulence driven at velocities higher than the Alfvén velocity, i.e., super-Alfvénic turbulence, is widely spread in astrophysical environments, including galaxy clusters and molecular clouds. For statistical studies of such turbulence, we explore the utility of the polarization angle structure functions $D^φ(R)= \left\langle\sin^2(φ_1-φ_2) \right\rangle$, where $φ$ denotes the polarization angle measured at points separated by a projected distance $\mathbf{R}$ on the plane of the sky. Lazarian, Yuen and Pogosyan, 2022, showed that in the case of super-Alfvénic turbulence, the spectral slope of $D^φ(\mathbf{R})$ differs from that of the underlying magnetic fluctuations, limiting its applicability for field strength estimation with known techniques. In this work, we provide an analytical framework that explains the modification of the $D^φ(R)$ spectral slope in super-Alfvénic turbulence and validate our predictions with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that for super-Alfvénic turbulence, the structure function $D^φ(R)$ gets shallower with the increase of $M_A$. Our study makes $D^φ(R)$ a valuable diagnostic of super-Alfvénic turbulence and opens a way to obtain $M_A$ from observations. We also explore numerically the structure function of the polarization degree and the spectrum of the polarization directions, the latter being the Fourier transform of $D^φ$. We discuss the implications of our findings for turbulence and magnetic field studies in the intracluster and interstellar media.

*Steven D Miller*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 从Vlasov-Poisson方程直接推导等温气体球体的力学，通过极值化玻尔兹曼熵得到自引力等温牛顿气体的麦克斯韦-玻尔兹曼分布，并推导相应的Poisson-Boltzmann方程。

Motivation: 探索动力学理论、统计力学和恒星结构之间的深层联系，强调经典天体物理模型的形式方面。

Method: 通过极值化玻尔兹曼熵，从Vlasov-Poisson方程推导等温气体球体的力学，获得麦克斯韦-玻尔兹曼分布作为Vlasov-Poisson系统的稳态解。

Result: 重现了经典的Antonov不稳定性判据，推导了等温气体球的基本方程、流体静力学平衡方程、能量积分和维里定理，证明等温气体具有负比热。

Conclusion: 等温气体球体具有恒定密度是不可能的，这项工作强调了动力学理论、统计力学和恒星结构之间的深层联系和自洽性。

Abstract: We present a derivation of the mechanics of isothermal gas spheres directly from the Vlasov--Poisson equation. By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov--Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson--Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \simeq -0.335\,\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called "gravothermal catastrophe"). In this work, we assume $E>E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov--Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat. Furthermore, we show that an isothermal gas sphere of strictly constant density is an impossibility. This exposition emphasizes some of the deep connections and self-consistency between kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and stellar structure, while highlighting some formal aspects of classical astrophysical models.

### [10] [Stellar Populations with MaNGA: Iron Kink and Nitrogen Fuzz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08827)
*Guy Worthey,Tathagata Pal*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 对2968个MaNGA早型星系的分析发现两个新趋势：1) Fe丰度在速度弥散度σ≈100 km/s处出现拐点，先上升后下降；2) 低σ星系中N丰度存在较大天体物理弥散，可能由AGB星提供并受恒星形成历史影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究早型星系化学丰度与速度弥散度的关系，揭示星系形成和演化过程中的物理机制，特别是通过观测到的丰度趋势验证理论模型。

Method: 分析2968个MaNGA早型星系的观测数据，结合TNG100模拟验证观测结果，通过化学丰度与速度弥散度的相关性研究星系形成历史。

Result: 发现Fe丰度在σ≈100 km/s处出现拐点，N丰度在低σ星系中存在较大弥散，TNG100模拟重现了Fe丰度拐点，支持等级合并过程解释。

Conclusion: Fe丰度拐点可由等级合并过程解释，N丰度弥散表明低质量星系具有变化的恒星形成历史，支持时间尺度论证来解释[Mg/Fe]趋势。

Abstract: Recent analysis of 2968 MaNGA early type galaxies has yielded two notable trends with velocity dispersion ($σ$) not previously discussed in the literature. First, Fe abundance rises with $σ$, but only until $σ\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $σ< 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$σ$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported.

### [11] [Continuum variability in multi-epoch quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08933)

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本研究利用斯隆数字巡天的多时期光谱数据，分析了约90,000个活动星系核的连续谱变异性。通过构建结构函数，发现变异性主要与光度L和波长λ相关，而与爱丁顿比无关。变异性时标τ∝L^0.62λ^1.74，与标准吸积盘模型预测基本一致，但在短波长下λ的指数显著降低，表明径向温度剖面可能比标准模型预测的更陡峭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究活动星系核连续谱变异性与黑洞质量、光度、爱丁顿比等参数的关系，检验标准吸积盘模型的预测，探索AGN变异性物理机制。

Method: 利用斯隆数字巡天约200万对多时期光谱数据，构建结构函数分析AGN变异性，按黑洞质量、光度、爱丁顿比等参数对样本分组，研究变异性与这些参数的相关性。

Result: 结构函数与光度L、爱丁顿比和波长λ强相关。当固定各参数时，变异性主要依赖于L和λ，与爱丁顿比无关。变异性时标τ∝L^0.62λ^1.74，与标准模型预测τ∝L^0.5λ^2基本一致。但在短波长下λ指数降至1.12±0.24，显著低于预测值。

Conclusion: AGN连续谱变异性主要受光度和波长影响，变异性时标关系与标准吸积盘模型预测基本一致，但在短波长下观测到的λ指数偏低，表明径向温度剖面可能比标准模型预测的更陡峭，或存在其他物理机制影响变异性。

Abstract: We examine the continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by analyzing the multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To achieve this, we utilized approximately 2 million spectroscopy pairwise combinations observed across different epochs for $\sim90,000$ AGNs. We estimate the ensemble variability structure function (SF) for subsamples categorized by various AGN properties, such as black hole mass, AGN luminosity ($L$), and Eddington ratio, to investigate how AGN variability depends on these parameters. We found that the SFs are strongly correlated with $L$, Eddington ratio, and rest-frame wavelength ($λ$). The analysis, with each parameter held fixed, reveals that SFs depend primarily on $L$ and $λ$, but not on the Eddington ratio. Consequently, under the assumption that AGNs follow a universal SF, we found that the variability timescale ($τ$) is proportional to both $L$ and $λ$, expressed as $τ\propto L^{0.62\pm0.07} λ^{1.74\pm0.23}$. This result is broadly consistent with predictions from the standard accretion disk model ($τ\propto L^{0.5} λ^{2}$). However, when considering only shorter wavelengths ($λ\leq 3050$ Å) to minimize contamination from the host galaxy and the Balmer continuum, the power-law index for $λ$ drops significantly to $1.12 \pm 0.24$. This value is lower than predicted by approximately $3-$4\ σ$, suggesting that the radial temperature profile may be systematically steeper than that predicted by the standard disk model, although other mechanisms may also contribute to this discrepancy. These findings highlight the power of temporal spectroscopic data in probing AGN variability, as they allow robust estimation of continuum fluxes without interference from strong emission lines.

TL;DR: 利用JWST的MIRI-MRS观测数据，结合CLOUDY模拟分析，发现银河系中心区域主要由温暖电离气体主导，CND区域有显著分子气体贡献，而CC区域分子气体含量极少。观测到的元素丰度模式表明这是化学年轻环境，主要由核心坍缩超新星和恒星风富集。

Motivation: 研究银河系中心区域（CND和CC）的气体成分和化学演化，了解不同气体相的空间分布及其对光谱发射的贡献。

Method: 使用JWST的MIRI-MRS仪器获取5-27μm光谱数据，结合CLOUDY光致电离代码生成合成光谱，模拟不同气体相和丰度，通过空间分析确定各相在数据立方体中的贡献。

Result: 在CND和CC区域，大部分发射来自温度在10^4-10^4.8K的温暖电离气体。CND中分子气体贡献显著且空间结构化，CC中分子气体含量极少。在两个区域都检测到分子气体与温暖电离气体界面处的日冕气体。元素丰度模式显示化学年轻环境特征。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持大质量、近期恒星形成的场景，而非长期累积富集，表明银河系中心区域经历了最近的恒星形成活动，主要由核心坍缩超新星和恒星风提供化学富集。

Abstract: We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27~$μ$m in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $α$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST发现的LRDs在早期宇宙中数量庞大，其性质仍是个谜，既像活动星系核又像星系，这激发了人们对AGN中中心黑洞形成路径的新兴趣。

Method: 基于Sołtan论证和本地AGNs中宽Hβ线的异常回响，提出LRDs包含中等质量中心黑洞和嵌入其吸积盘中的大量恒星级黑洞的胚胎结构模型。

Result: 该模型能很好地解释LRDs的SED特征，恒星级黑洞吸积主导光学连续谱，中心黑洞吸积盘和核星暴共同贡献UV连续谱，形成观测到的V形SED。

Conclusion: 提出的Chimera模型成功解释了LRDs的观测特征，避免了超大质量黑洞的问题，并讨论了包括引力波在内的LRDs演化过程。

Abstract: As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST-discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as ``Chimeras" like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M_{\bullet}\lesssim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$β$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M_{\bullet}<\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用光学光谱指数α5100变化来探测宽线活动星系核中次秒差距双黑洞系统的新方法，基于双黑洞系统引起的遮蔽效应导致的光谱指数异常变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测宽线活动星系核中的次秒差距双黑洞系统，因为传统的探测方法有限，而双黑洞系统的遮蔽效应会导致光学光谱指数的独特变化。

Method: 通过分析光学光谱指数α5100与连续谱光度L5100的关系，以及α5100的周期性变化，来识别次秒差距双黑洞系统的特征信号。

Result: 在候选体SDSS J0012-1022中观测到α5100的独特变化，这可以通过假设的次秒差距双黑洞系统的遮蔽效应来解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为探测宽线活动星系核中的次秒差距双黑洞系统提供了一种新的光学连续谱分析方法，未来应重点关注α5100的周期性变化探测。

Abstract: In this manuscript, variations in optical spectral index $α_{5100}$ are applied for detecting central sub-parsec binary black hole systems (sub-pc BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN), due to apparent effects of obscurations on central two BH accreting systems. For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $α_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $α_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $α_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $α_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $α_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH. In the near future, to detect and report periodic variations of $α_{5100}$ for sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN should be our main objective. The results provide a new method by applications of properties of optical continuum emissions for detecting sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN.

Motivation: 传统模型通常考虑核区球形星暴，但近期观测显示星暴发生在环状区域，如NGC 253星系。本研究旨在分析环状星暴对星系风的影响及其不对称性。

Method: 使用AMRVAC流体动力学代码模拟来自不同垂直位置中央环状星暴的星系风喷射。

Result: 环状星暴产生比球形星暴更复杂的风结构，能形成具有Hα发射的致密丝状结构。星暴垂直位置变化可导致风瓣质量通量差异达一个数量级，但这种差异仅在短时间内持续。

Conclusion: 环状星暴分布显著影响星系风的结构和不对称性，为理解观测到的星系风不对称性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Star formation bursts promote the ejection of material from the hosting galaxies due to the momentum and energy injected by winds from massive stars and supernova explosions. Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用氢化非晶硅平行板电容器的铝动能电感探测器的低频噪声特性，发现该器件在暗条件下以生成复合噪声为主，在光学负载下以生成复合噪声和光子噪声为主，证明了该探测器设计在天文观测等低调制率应用中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于下一代扩展波长多波段亚毫米波电感相机(NEW-MUSIC)的新型探测器技术，评估氢化非晶硅平行板电容器在低频噪声性能方面的表现，确保探测器在各种观测条件下能够达到光子噪声限制。

Method: 测量微带耦合、集总元件铝动能电感探测器的低频噪声特性，该探测器采用氢化非晶硅平行板电容器，在暗条件和光学负载下分别进行噪声分析。

Result: 在暗条件下，器件在0.1 Hz以下以生成复合噪声为主；在光学负载下，在十分之一赫兹及以下频率范围内可能以生成复合噪声和光子噪声为主。测量结果与0.1-10 kHz频段的更高频率测量结果一致。

Conclusion: 该MS-PPC-LEKID设计在NEW-MUSIC中将在一系列观测条件下达到光子噪声限制，氢化非晶硅平行板电容器动能电感探测器是一种可行的新型探测器技术，适用于天文等低调制率应用。

Abstract: We present measurements of the low-frequency noise of microstrip-coupled, lumped-element aluminum kinetic inductance detectors that use hydrogenated amorphous silicon parallel-plate capacitors (Al/a-Si:H MS-PPC-LEKIDs), which are under development for the Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multiband Submillimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC). We show that, under dark conditions, these devices are generation recombination (GR) noise dominated down to 0.1 Hz and, under optical load, they are likely dominated by GR and photon noise down to tenths of a Hz and possibly lower, both in spite of the use of a-Si:H PPCs. Our measurements set limits on the low-frequency two-level-system (TLS) noise of the a-Si:H material that are consistent with higher frequency measurements in the 0.1-10 kHz regime. These results establish that our MS-PPC-LEKID design for NEW-MUSIC will be photon-noise-limited under a range of observing conditions and, more generally, that a-Si:H PPC-KIDs are a viable new detector technology for even low modulation-rate applications such as astronomy.

Motivation: 开发AlMn KIDs用于90 GHz频段，因为铝的配对破坏能量过高，而AlMn作为KID材料的研究尚不充分。

Method: 首先改进了BCS理论中铝KID的建模技术，消除了复杂电导率表达式的解析近似，然后测试了添加能隙展宽参数的方法。

Result: 改进的建模技术减少了AlMn分析中的拟合参数退化性，但添加能隙展宽参数并未改善拟合效果。

Conclusion: AlMn KIDs在90 GHz频段具有应用潜力，改进的BCS建模方法有效，但标准能隙展宽扩展不适用于该材料。

Abstract: We report on the optical characterization of the AlMn kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) in development for use in the Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT). NEW-MUSIC will cover 80-420 GHz, split into six spectral bands, with polarimetry. This broad spectral coverage will enable study of a range of scientific topics such as the accretion and feedback in galaxies and galaxy cluster evolution via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the transient synchrotron emission from the explosive deaths of massive stars and other time-domain phenomena, and dusty sources from low to high redshift (with polarization). Al KIDs have already been demonstrated for bands 2-5. AlMn KIDs will be used for the 90~GHz band, as Al's pair-breaking energy is too high. However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn. Then, we tested the addition of a gap smearing parameter, a standard extension to BCS theory in use for high kinetic inductance materials, and found it did not improve the fits.

Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multi-band Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC), located on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT), will be the first six-band trans-millimeter wave polarimeter. This paper proposes a broadband, hierarchical phased-array antenna with integrated band-defining filters necessary to realize NEW-MUSIC. It covers a spectral bandwidth of 2.4 octaves from 80~GHz to 420~GHz, a frequency range ideal for studying trans-millimeter emission from a range of time-domain sources, using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study hot plasmas in galaxy clusters and galaxies, and to observe dusty sources, from star-forming regions in our galaxy to high-redshift dusty, star-forming galaxies. To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).

Abstract: In this paper, progress in improving the coordinates uncertainty of extragalactic radio sources derived from astrometric and geodetic VLBI observations is investigated. For this purpose, 30 catalogs of radio source positions computed in 1997-2025 were analyzed. Over these years, the median source position uncertainty represented by the semi-major axis of the error ellipse for 467 sources in common to all catalogs improved by one order of magnitude: from 0.156 mas to 0.015 mas. It was also found that the improvement in the position uncertainty over time follows a power law with high accuracy. The number of observations used for determination of the coordinates of the common sources in the input catalogs increased over time from 1.3 to 14.4 million, also following a power law. A discussion of the results led us to the conclusion that the number of observations is the primary factor in improving the source positions uncertainty compared to the number of sessions in which the source was observed.

Abstract: The High Sensitivity Terahertz Detection Module (HSTDM), a key component of the backend modules on board the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), will offer great opportunities for the discovery of Terahertz Astronomy, with implications that extend well beyond China to the global astronomical community.It is imperative that the raw data collected by HSTDM undergoes meticulous calibration and processing through the HSTDM data processing pipeline (HSTDM pipeline for short) to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the final science data to be archived for further research.This process necessitates that the HSTDM pipeline address instrumental artifacts and effects as well as the coordination of data flow of the scheduled observing sequences under all observing modes of HSTDM within the CSST automated processing environment.As the understanding of CSST HSTDM data processing develops during the pipeline development stage, it becomes essential to assess the accuracy, the robustness and the performance of the HSTDM pipeline under all observing modes of HSTDM so that components of the HSTDM pipeline be rationally added, removed, amended or extended within the modular framework.In this paper, we develop practical simulation methods to facilitate this need. The contribution of synthetic data generation of HSTDM observation includes two parts: 1. HSTDM instrumental effect simulation based on both real testing profiles and simulated models; 2. Observing data flow generation based on HSTDM observing mode scenario. The simulation methods have been implemented and shown to be practical in testing the HSTDM pipeline during the development stage.

Abstract: Radiative transfer is a key bottleneck in computational astrophysics: it is nonlocal, stiff, and tightly coupled to hydrodynamics. We introduce Ray-trax, a GPU-oriented, fully differentiable 3D ray tracer written in JAX that solves the time-dependent emission--absorption problem and runs directly on turbulent gas fields produced by hydrodynamic simulations. The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability. We validate against analytical solutions, demonstrate propagation in turbulent media, and perform a simple inverse problem via gradient-based optimization. In practice, the memory footprint scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{src}}\,N_{\text{cells}})$ while remaining highly efficient on accelerators.

Motivation: 伽马射线暴是宇宙中最活跃的事件之一，但其发射机制仍不清楚。偏振测量对于理解其喷射结构、磁场配置和辐射机制至关重要。POLAR任务提供了重要的偏振数据，但受限于灵敏度、有效面积和能量范围。

Conclusion: POLAR-2由瑞士、中国、波兰和德国联合开发，计划于2027年发射，目前正处于生产阶段，将显著提升伽马射线暴偏振测量的能力。

Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.

Abstract: LunPAN (Lunar Particle Analyzer Network) is a three-year mission proposal designed to comprehensively map the particle spectra in the lunar radiation field. It aims to provide precise measurements of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Energetic Particles (SEP), and albedo particles, including charged particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays, originating from the Moon's surface. Therefore it will contribute to fundamental space physics, lunar geology sciences, space weather prediction, and radiation risk assessment for future lunar explorations. This is achieved through two state-of-the-art instruments; Pix.PAN and NeuPix. Pix.PAN is a compact magnetic spectrometer designed for precise measurements of penetrating charged particles, ranging from 100 MeV to 10 GeV. Based on the Mini.PAN project, Pix.PAN employs thin silicon pixel sensors optimized for energy resolution and particle identification. NeuPix is a hybrid active pixel sensor system capable of detecting neutrons, gamma-rays, and lower-energy charged particles between 10MeV and 100 MeV. Utilizing innovative sensor-converter combinations, NeuPix will provide spectral measurements of lunar albedo neutrons and gamma-ray fluxes. Currently, the LunPAN mission is accepted by ESA's "Small Missions for Exploration - Destination the Moon" call for a pre-A phase study. We will discuss mission outline and expected scientific performance of the PixPAN and NeuPix.

Abstract: The spatial sensitivity pattern of millimeter-wavelength receivers is an important diagnostic of performance and is affected by the alignment of coupling optics. Characterization can be challenging in the field, particularly in the decentered and tightly packed optical configurations that are employed for many astronomical millimeter-wave cameras. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a lightweight and reconfigurable beam mapper, consisting of a bank of thermal sources positioned by a planar cable-driven robot. We describe how the measurement requirements and mechanical constraints of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) optical relay drive the design of the mapper. To quantify the positioning performance, we predict the beam patterns at each surface to derive requirements and use a non-contact computer-vision based method built on OpenCV to track the payload position with an accuracy better than 1.0 mm. We achieve an in-plane absolute payload position error of 2.7 mm (RMSE) over a $\sim$400 mm $\times$ 400 mm workspace and an in-plane repeatability of 0.81 mm, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and speed over traditional handheld techniques.

Motivation: 验证TIME仪器的超光谱成像能力，为未来的谱线强度映射巡天做准备，特别是在复杂银河系场中恢复连续谱和谱线信号。

Method: 使用木星观测校准探测器增益和指向偏移，通过专用数据处理流水线去除相关噪声，包括相关加权缩放的共模减法和地图域主成分分析来识别系统误差。

Result: 成功恢复了强12CO(2-1)和13CO(2-1)发射线，区分了核周盘中的自由-自由发射与分子云中的热尘埃发射，与BGPS的连续谱通量比较在5%内一致，估计分子氢质量为5.4-5.7×10^5 M⊙。

Conclusion: TIME仪器已准备好进行即将到来的河外星系CO和[C II]巡天，能够有效处理复杂银河系场中的连续谱和谱线信号。

Abstract: We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.

### [26] [No TiO detected in the hot Neptune-desert planet LTT-9779 b in reflected light at high spectral resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08691)
*Sophia R. Vaughan,Jayne L. Birkby,Natasha E. Batalha,Luke T. Parker,Haochuan Yu,Julia V. Seidel,Michael Radica,Jake Taylor,Laura Kreidberg,Vivien Parmentier,Sergio Hoyer,James S. Jenkins,Annabella Meech,Ricardo Ramírez Reyes,Lennart van Sluijs*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文使用ESPRESSO高分辨率光谱仪观测LTT-9779 b行星，试图探测其反射光谱以区分云层和大气金属丰度的影响，但未成功检测到反射光谱信号。通过注入测试表明TiO可能在西半球耗尽，同时约束了东西半球云顶高度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTT-9779 b位于热海王星沙漠区域，是少数已知高反照率行星之一。表征其大气特性对于理解热海王星沙漠形成机制至关重要，特别是要打破云层和大气金属丰度之间的简并性，以解释其质量损失历史。

Method: 使用ESPRESSO高分辨率交叉相关光谱技术，在4-UT模式下对LTT-9779 b进行了四个半晚的观测，有效镜面尺寸16.4米，旨在约束行星的反射光谱。

Result: 尽管数据灵敏度达到预期水平（100 ppm），但未检测到LTT-9779 b的反射光谱。注入测试表明TiO应该在不同平衡化学模型中都被检测到，因此非检测暗示西半球TiO耗尽。同时约束了西半球云顶高度<10^{-2.0} bar，东半球云顶高度<10^{-0.5} bar。

Conclusion: 虽然未检测到反射光谱，但验证了该技术可用于表征系外行星的高分辨率反射光谱，前提是光谱包含足够数量的深谱线。这项技术可能成为未来ELT及更远望远镜进行系外行星表征的重要基石。

Abstract: LTT-9779 b is an inhabitant of the hot Neptune desert and one of only a few planets with a measured high albedo. Characterising the atmosphere of this world is the key to understanding what processes dominate in creating the hot Neptune desert. We aim to characterise the reflected light of LTT-9779 b at high spectral resolution to break the degeneracy between clouds and atmospheric metallicity. This is key to interpreting its mass loss history which may illuminate how it kept its place in the desert. We use the high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy technique on four half-nights of ESPRESSO observations in 4-UT mode (16.4-m effective mirror) to constrain the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b. We do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b despite these data having the expected sensitivity at the level 100 ppm. Injection tests on the post-eclipse data indicate that TiO should have been detected for a range of different equilibrium chemistry models. Therefore this non-detection suggests TiO depletion in the western hemisphere however, this conclusion is sensitive to temperature which impacts the chemistry in the upper atmosphere and the reliability of the line list. Additionally, we are able to constrain the top of the western cloud deck to $P_{\text{top, western}}<10^{-2.0}$ bar and the top of the eastern cloud deck $P_{\text{top, eastern}}<10^{-0.5}$ bar, which is consistent with the predicted altitude of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds from JWST NIRISS/SOSS. While we do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b, we have verified that this technique can be used in practice to characterise the high spectral resolution reflected light of exoplanets so long as their spectra contain a sufficient number of deep spectral lines. Therefore this technique may become an important cornerstone of exoplanet characterisation with the ELT and beyond.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过天王星轨道器和探测器（UOP）的近距离轨道可以更精确地测量天王星的多极重力场，用于研究其内部结构和风场深度。研究发现J8、J5和J7重力矩是探测风场深度的最佳指标，可在高度倾斜轨道中通过10次以上近心点通过进行测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对天王星重力场的了解仅限于J2和J4，这限制了对其内部结构和风场深度的理解。通过UOP任务测量更高阶重力矩，可以更好地约束天王星的内部特性和风场结构。

Method: 通过模拟候选UOP轨道来研究Jn重力矩的灵敏度极限，结合天王星内部和风场模型进行重力矩反演。考虑基于特征追踪数据推导的纬向风剖面，假设纬向风沿圆柱体延伸到行星内部，并采用与解释木星和土星重力场相似的径向衰减函数。

Result: 当前对J2和J4的了解允许天王星风场深度可达1,800公里或半径的7%。J6主要受整体旋转主导，不适合探测风场深度。J3受风剖面不确定性影响较大。J8、J5和J7重力矩是探测天王星风场深度的最佳指标，可在高度倾斜轨道中通过10次以上近心点通过进行测量。

Conclusion: 测量额外的重力矩对于分离风场深度与其他内部特性至关重要。J8、J5和J7重力矩是探测天王星风场深度的最佳探针，这些测量可以通过UOP任务在高度倾斜轨道中实现。

Abstract: Close orbits by a Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) could be used to deduce Uranus's multipolar gravity field to higher precision and angular degree than the J2 and J4 currently measured from ground-based ring occultations and the Voyager 2 flyby. We examine Jn sensitivity limits obtained from simulations of candidate UOP trajectories, pairing these with Uranus interior and wind models to perform retrievals from the gravity moments. We consider zonal wind profiles derived from recent feature-tracking data, assuming that zonal winds extend into the planet along cylinders, with a radial decay function similar to those that explain Jupiter and Saturn gravity. Present knowledge of J2 and J4 permits a fairly wide range of possible wind depths in Uranus, up to 1,800 km or 7% by radius. Measuring additional gravity moments is essential to separate this unknown wind depth from other interior properties of interest, but J6 is found to be too dominated by bulk rotation to be a useful probe of the wind depth. Odd moments arising from Uranus's observed north-south asymmetric flow are strong functions of the wind depth, but the usefulness of J3 is hindered by its sensitivity to present uncertainties in the wind profile. The even moment J8, or the odd moments J5 and J7, are the best probes of the depth of Uranus's winds. J8, and most likely J5 and J7, are measurable in a highly inclined orbit making >~10 pericenter passages inward of the $ζ$ ring, approximately 1,000-2,500 km above Uranus's cloud tops.

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了非惯性参考系中多体引力系统的间接加速度概念，提出更物理合理的定义方式，使得间接加速度对所有物体相同，并能自然解释系统动量、角动量和能量不守恒的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统天体力学中非惯性参考系下的间接加速度定义存在物理不一致性，每个物体的间接加速度不同，且有效二体势不满足等效原理，需要更合理的物理解释。

Method: 通过重新定义间接加速度的概念，使其对所有系统内物体相同，并将非惯性参考系中的动量、角动量和能量不守恒现象归因于间接加速度作为外力的作用。

Result: 新的间接加速度定义使得：1）所有物体的间接加速度相同；2）系统整体动量、角动量和能量在非惯性系中的不守恒自然得到解释；3）经典二体问题的活力积分不应被解释为能量守恒。

Conclusion: 重新定义的间接加速度概念提供了更物理合理的解释框架，有助于理解各种天体物理背景下的动力学，特别是盘-行星耦合物理。

Abstract: The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation. In fact, the energy of relative motion is not conserved due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.

Abstract: Impact cratering plays a crucial role in shaping the surfaces of small bodies, satellites, and planets, providing insights into their formation and the history of the Solar System. Small bodies are often covered with low-cohesion regolith. Using sand as a model of regolith, we constructed a numerical model for simulating impact on a sand target to investigate the mechanisms of crater formation and impact-induced seismic waves. Soda-lime glass and quartz sand targets were used for comparison. The developed sand model successfully reproduced the sound velocity measured in an experimental study. Using the new sand model, the crater formation was simulated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with a material strength parameter. The crater radius and $π$-scaling law derived from the numerical simulation were consistent with the experimental study. The vertical acceleration around the surface of the crater was consistent with the experimentally measured acceleration for the impact-induced seismic wave. The developed model can provide insight for predicting the size of craters on unknown small bodies.

Abstract: On 27 December 2024, near-Earth object (NEO) 2024 YR$_4$ was discovered by the ATLAS survey and identified as a virtual impactor. A few weeks later, it eventually reached level 3 on the Torino Scale and was the first and only asteroid to be ever classified at that level. Here we report an intensive observational campaign combining time-series photometry in the visible, broadband visible and near-infrared colors, and low-resolution visible reflectance spectroscopy to assess its physical properties. Fourier analysis of the lightcurves yields a synodic rotation period of $P = 19.46341 \pm 0.00008$ min, placing 2024 YR$_4$ among the fast rotators, even if such rotation is common for objects of similar $H$ magnitude. Its visible and near-infrared colors and spectra are most consistent with an Sq or K taxonomic classification, though some ambiguity remains. Finally, its phase curve exhibits a notably shallow slope ($G = 0.51 \pm 0.11$), from which we derive an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{R} = 23.82\pm0.09$ mag. After color correction and taking into account other models for the phase function, we report an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{V} = 24.14\pm0.25$ mag. These characterizations, rotation period, taxonomy, and surface properties, would have been crucial for risk assessment and mitigation planning had the initially high impact probability scenario been confirmed, underscoring the importance for planetary defense of a rapid, coordinated international response.

TL;DR: 本文使用密度泛函理论和动力学蒙特卡洛模拟研究了H₂、H₂O和CO在碳质和硅酸盐尘埃表面的吸附行为，揭示了两种不同的吸附机制及其对原行星盘尘埃演化的影响。

Motivation: 研究尘埃表面挥发性分子的吸附行为对于理解原行星盘中气体分子凝结、尘埃聚集和行星形成等关键过程具有重要意义。

Method: 采用先进的从头算密度泛函理论（r²SCAN+rVV10范德华泛函）计算吸附能，并结合动力学蒙特卡洛模拟研究表面演化过程。

Result: 碳质表面表现为弱物理吸附（|Δεad|∼0.1-0.2 eV），而硅酸盐表面表现为强化学吸附（|Δεad|∼0.5-1.5 eV）。H₂O和CO共晶显著提高CO的解吸温度，硅酸盐在大部分盘区域保持化学吸附分子涂层。

Conclusion: 碳质和硅酸盐尘埃表面的吸附机制存在根本差异，这种表面覆盖的二分法可能为内行星系统中碳耗竭提供自然机制，气体分子耗竭半径是温度、化学成分和演化轨迹的综合结果。

Abstract: The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced {\it ab-initio} density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|Δε_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|Δε_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.

Abstract: The icy surface of Europa is continuously bombarded by ions and electrons from Jupiter's magnetosphere. The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.

Motivation: 研究低金属丰度环境下大质量恒星的多重性，这对理解早期宇宙中大质量恒星演化、奇异瞬变事件产生、引力波前身星以及电离辐射产生具有重要意义。

Method: 使用九次VLT/FLAMES光谱观测，分析了929颗大质量恒星的多重性特性。

Result: O型星内禀紧密双星比例为70%，早期B型矮星/巨星约为80%，远高于高金属丰度样本；B0-B3超巨星降至约40%，A-F超巨星仅为约8%（可能因内禀变异性而被高估）。OBe星显示出独特的双星性质。

Conclusion: 这些结果对低金属丰度下大质量恒星演化具有深远影响，包括奇异瞬变事件、引力波前身星和早期宇宙电离辐射的产生。

Abstract: We present an overview of our recent results from the BLOeM campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud ($Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_{\odot}$). Using nine-epoch VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy, we investigated the multiplicity of 929 massive stars. Our findings reveal contrasting binary properties across evolutionary stages: O-type stars show an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $70\%$, and early B-type dwarfs/giants reach ${\sim80}\%$, exceeding higher-metallicity samples. In contrast, B0-B3 supergiants drop to ${\sim40}\%$, and A-F supergiants to ${\sim8}\%$; intrinsic variability likely inflates the latter, so the true multiplicity may be lower. OBe stars display distinct binary properties consistent with a post-interaction origin. These results have profound implications for massive-star evolution at low metallicity, including the production of exotic transients, gravitational-wave progenitors, and ionising radiation in the early Universe.

Motivation: 百万度太阳日冕加热的性质和详细特性仍是未解决的重要问题，纳米耀斑加热可能在活动区和宁静太阳中占主导地位，但直接观测这些小尺度事件在高度导电的微弱日冕中很困难。

Abstract: The nature and detailed properties of the heating of the million-degree solar corona are important issues that are still largely unresolved. Nanoflare heating might be dominant in active regions and quiet Sun, although direct signatures of such small-scale events are difficult to observe in the highly conducting, faint corona. The aim of this work is to test the theory of coronal heating by nanoflares in braided magnetic field structures. We analyze a 3D MHD model of a multistrand flux tube in a stratified solar atmosphere, driven by twisting motions at the boundaries. We show how the magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time, by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection. We forward-modelled optically thin emission with SDO/AIA and MUSE and compared the synthetic observations with the intrinsic coronal plasma properties, focusing on the response to impulsive coronal heating. Currents build up and their impulsive dissipation into heat are also investigated through different runs. In this first paper, we describe the proliferation of heating from the dissipation of narrow current sheets in realistic simulations of braided coronal flux tubes at unprecedented high spatial resolutions.

Abstract: Recent observations of fast and bursty ``nanojets'' suggest novel diagnostics of nanoflare heating in the solar corona. The aim of this work is to investigate the presence and properties of reconnection outflows, similar to observed nanojets, in numerical simulations, and explore their relationship with the nanoflare properties. This work explores their potential as diagnostics for nanoflare heating in observations. We developed an algorithm of Reconnection Outflows Automatic Detection (ROAD) in 3D MHD simulations of coronal loops. We applied the algorithm to a 3D MHD stratified coronal loop model heated by magnetic reconnection and analyzed the statistical properties of the jets produced at reconnection sites, over about one solar hour. The magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection.

TL;DR: JWST-MIRI观测显示两个具有相似性质的经典T Tauri星GM Aur和J1615在碳分子发射方面存在显著差异：J1615表现出丰富的碳分子发射，而GM Aur仅检测到H2O和OH。这种差异可能与J1615较低的吸积率和更处理过的尘埃颗粒有关。

Motivation: 研究具有相似恒星和盘性质的经典T Tauri星在碳分子发射方面的差异，以了解行星形成环境的化学多样性。

Method: 使用JWST-MIRI中分辨率光谱仪观测，通过局部热力学平衡平板模型分析13.6-17.7微米波长范围内的光谱线，同时测量吸积率并进行SED建模。

Result: J1615显示出H2O、HCN、C2H2、12CO2、13CO2、OH和13C12CH2的强发射，而GM Aur仅检测到H2O和OH。J1615的吸积率低于GM Aur，且其盘中含有更多结晶硅酸盐和更大尘埃颗粒。

Conclusion: J1615被识别为富碳过渡盘，其增强的碳发射可能是较低吸积率和更处理过的内盘尘埃共同作用的结果，这为行星形成环境的化学多样性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present JWST-MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations of the Classical T Tauri stars GM Aur and RX J1615.3-3255 (J1615), both hosting transitional disks. Despite their similar stellar and disk properties, the two systems differ strikingly in their carbon-bearing molecular emission. Using local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) slab models to analyze spectral lines within the 13.6-17.7 micron wavelength range, we find that J1615 exhibits strong emission from H2O, HCN, C2H2, 12CO2, 13CO2, OH, and 13C12CH2, whereas GM Aur shows only H2O and OH. We measure the accretion rates of both objects using contemporaneous optical spectra and find that J1615's accretion rate is lower than that of GM Aur. We constrain the properties of the dust in both disks using SED modeling and find elevated amounts of crystalline silicates and larger dust grains in the disk of J1615. The enhanced carbon emission in J1615 may result from a combination of lower accretion rate and larger and more processed dust grains in the inner disk, conditions that together may allow carbon-rich gas to persist and be detected. These results expand the sample of protoplanetary disks around solar-mass stars with strong CO2 and C2H2 emission and identify J1615 as a carbon-rich transitional disk, providing new insights into the chemical diversity of planet-forming environments.

Abstract: The death of massive stars is triggered by an infall-induced bounce shock that disrupts the star. How such a shock is launched and propagates through the star is a decade-long puzzle. Some models assume that the shock can be reenergized by absorbing neutrinos, leading to highly aspherical explosions. Other models involve jet-powered shocks that lead to bipolar explosions reflected in the geometry of the shock-breakout emission. We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting ~1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion. These findings suggest that the physical mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars manifests a well-defined axial symmetry and acts on large scales.

Motivation: 罗马日冕仪是首个能够在太空中进行高阶波前传感和控制的高对比度仪器，为未来的宜居世界天文台（HWO）提供关键技术演示。参考星的选择对高对比度成像性能至关重要，但现有标准限制了候选星样本，且伴星率高。

Result: 识别了58颗参考星候选（40颗主要+18颗备用），在初步观测中未发现新的伴星。

Conclusion: 需要在罗马日冕仪观测前进行更高对比度的观测来充分验证参考星候选，同时参考星选择标准对罗马和HWO的观测规划具有重要影响。

Abstract: The upcoming Roman Coronagraph will be the first high-contrast instrument in space capable of high-order wavefront sensing and control technologies, a critical technology demonstration for the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that aims to directly image and characterize habitable exoEarths. The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as "digging a dark hole", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V<3, a resolved stellar diameter <2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions. We discuss the need for higher-contrast observations to sufficiently vet these reference star candidates prior to Roman Coronagraph observations along with the implications of reference star criteria on observation planning for Roman and HWO.

Abstract: Magnetic fields in the upper atmospheres of solar-like stars are believed to provide an enormous amount of energy to power the hot coronae and drive large-scale eruptions that could impact the habitability of planetary systems around these stars. However, these magnetic fields have never been routinely measured on stars beyond the solar system. Through decade-long spectropolarimetric observations, we have now achieved the measurements of magnetic fields in the lower and middle chromospheres of three M-dwarfs. Our results indicate that the line-of-sight component of the chromospheric magnetic fields can reach up to hundreds of Gauss, whose sign frequently opposes that of the photospheric field. The measurements highlight the magnetic field complexity and the variation with height close to the surface of these M-dwarfs. They provide critical constraints on the energy budget responsible for heating and eruptions of stellar upper atmospheres, and enable assessments of how stellar magnetic activity may affect exoplanet environments.

Abstract: Solar flares, the most powerful explosive phenomena in the solar system, may pose significant hazards to spaceborne satellites and ground-based infrastructure. Despite decades of intensive research, reliable flare prediction remains a challenging task. Large Language Models, as a milestone in artificial intelligence, exhibit exceptional general knowledge and next-token prediction capabilities. Here we introduce JW-Flare, the first Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) explicitly trained for solar flare forecasting through fine-tuning on textual physic parameters of solar active regions and magnetic field images. This method demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for large flares prediction on the test dataset. It effectively identifies all 79 X-class flares from 18,949 test samples, yielding a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.95 and a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 1.00, outperforming traditional predictive models. We further investigate the capability origins of JW-Flare through explainability experiments, revealing that solar physics knowledge acquired during pre-training contributes to flare forecasting performance. Additionally, we evaluate models of different parameter scales, confirming the Scaling_Law of Large Language Models in domain-specific applications, such as solar physics. This study marks a substantial advance in both the scale and accuracy of solar flare forecasting and opens a promising avenue for AI-driven methodologies in broader scientific domains.

Method: 对选定演化序列模型计算了RGB、eAGB和TP-AGB演化阶段的径向脉动，分析了脉动周期与光度关系。

Result: 发现并非所有脉动红巨星都是Mira变星，TP-AGB阶段的脉动周期下限约为70天，而eAGB阶段的脉动周期为5-40天。Mira变星的小质量（0.54-0.70M⊙）导致不规则大振幅振荡和外部层的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 47 Tuc球状星团中Mira变星的小质量是导致其不规则脉动特性和动力学不稳定性的主要原因，不同演化阶段的脉动红巨星具有不同的脉动周期范围。

Abstract: Stellar evolution computations were carried out for stars with a main sequence mass $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=0.86M_\odot$ and initial metal abundance $Z=0.003$ and $Z=0.004$. Selected models of evolutionary sequences were used for calculation of radial pulsations in the RGB, eAGB and TP-AGB evolutionary stages. Not all pulsating red giants of the globular cluster 47 Tuc are shown to belong to the Mira variables because the lower limit of pulsation periods at the TP-AGB stage is $\approx 70$ day, whereas during the eAGB evolutionary stage the periods of radial oscillations range from $\approx 5$ to $\approx 40$ day. Periods and luminosities of hydrodynamic models of eAGB and TP--AGB pulsating stars locate along the common period-luminosity relation. Small masses of Mira variables in the globular cluster 47 Tuc ($0.54M_\odot\le M\le 0.70M_\odot$) is the main reason for irregular large-amplitude oscillations and the dynamical instability of outer stellar layers at pulsation periods $Π> 200$ day.

Motivation: 传统硬X射线探测器在大耀斑期间使用衰减器，限制了低能谱的诊断能力，无法同时分析耀斑中的热和超热等离子体成分。

Method: 联合拟合STIX背景探测器和成像探测器的硬X射线光谱，使用SUNKIT-SPEX软件包确定热和超热成分的谱参数。

Result: 在GOES X级耀斑中，硬X射线光谱更适合用双热成分描述；在温度峰值时，超热成分在15keV以上的通量通常强于热成分；GOES长波通道主要受热成分主导，超热贡献可达10%。

Conclusion: 相同探测器类型但不同衰减方案的联合光谱拟合是监测多热耀斑等离子体的简单而有效方法。

Abstract: Spectroscopic analysis of large flares (>X1) in the hard X-ray (HXR) range offers unique insights into the hottest (> 30 MK) flare plasma, the so-called superhot thermal component. To manage the high count rates in large flares, an attenuator is typically placed in front of the HXR detectors. However, this significantly limits the spectral diagnostic capabilities at lower energies, and consequently, it restricts the analysis of the lower temperatures in flares. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter mission was designed to observe solar flares in hard X-rays. The imaging detectors use an attenuator during periods of high flux level. In contrast, the background (BKG) detector of STIX is never covered by the attenuator and is therefore dedicated to measure the unattenuated flux using differently sized apertures placed in front of the detector. We aim to demonstrate that joint spectral fitting using different detector configurations of STIX allows us to reliably diagnose both the hot and the superhot components in large flares. We jointly fit the HXR spectra of the STIX BKG detector and the STIX imaging detectors using SUNKIT-SPEX software package to determine the spectral parameters of both the hot and superhot thermal components in solar flares. Using joint fitting on 32 STIX flares, we corroborate that for GOES X-class flares, the HXR spectrum is better represented by two thermal components instead of an isothermal component. At the temperature peak time, the superhot HXR flux above 15 keV is typically stronger than the hot HXR flux. The GOES long-wavelength channel is dominated by the hot component with a superhot contribution up to 10%. This paper demonstrates that joint spectral fitting of the same detector type with different attenuation schemes is a simple and powerful method to monitor multithermal flare plasma.

Motivation: CME在行星大气侵蚀中起关键作用，但此前从未在太阳系外恒星上明确探测到CME。现有研究只能通过其他恒星爆发事件间接推断CME的存在。

Method: 通过探测M矮星StKM 1-1262上的II型射电暴，这是CME在恒星日冕和行星际空间传播时产生激波的基本等离子体辐射特征。

Result: 探测到的射电暴在频率、时间和偏振特性上与太阳II型射电暴完全相同。估算M矮星上类似射电光度事件的速率为0.84^{+1.94}_{-0.69}×10^{-3}每天每颗星。

Conclusion: 这一发现使我们不再局限于将太阳CME的运动学和速率外推到其他恒星，首次建立了CME对系外行星影响的观测限制。

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive expulsions of magnetised plasma from a star, and are the largest contributors to space weather in the Solar System. CMEs are theorized to play a key role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star. However, such a conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside of our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive events. A signature of a fast CME is a Type II radio burst, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a Type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time, and polarisation properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar Type II burst. We demonstrate the rate of such events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs are 0.84$^{+1.94}_{-0.69} \times$10$^{-3}$ per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish the first observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$σ$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($α$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E>6.8\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($α= -0.81 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift.

Result: StKM 1-1262总磁场强度为3.53±0.06 kG，大尺度磁场呈偶极且适度轴对称，平均强度300 G；V374 Peg总磁场强度为5.46±0.09 kG，大尺度磁场呈偶极且轴对称，平均强度800 G。发现总磁场与有效温度之间存在反相关关系。

Conclusion: 两颗M矮星展现出不同的射电发射机制和磁场特性，磁场强度与有效温度的反相关关系反映了小尺度磁场与表面不均匀性之间的紧密联系。

Abstract: Radio observations at low frequencies are sensitive to the magnetic activity of stars and the plasma environment surrounding them. The accurate interpretation of the processes underlying the radio signatures requires a detailed characterisation of the stellar magnetism. We study two M dwarfs, StKM 1-1262 (M0 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=1.24$ d) and V374 Peg (M4 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=0.4455$ d), which were detected with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). StKM 1-1262 exhibited a type-II radio burst, potentially resulting from a coronal mass ejection event. V374 Peg manifested low-frequency radio emission typical of an electron-cyclotron maser instability emission mechanism. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of these M dwarfs collected with the SpectroPolarimètre InfraRouge (SPIRou). Firstly, we refined the stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, and measured the average surface magnetic flux via modelling of Zeeman broadening in unpolarised spectra. We then applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging to least-squares deconvolution line profiles in circular polarisation to reconstruct their large-scale magnetic fields. StKM 1-1262 has a total, unsigned magnetic field of $3.53\pm0.06$ kG on average and the large-scale magnetic field topology is dipolar and moderately axisymmetric, with an average strength of 300 G. V374 Peg has an unsigned magnetic field of $5.46\pm0.09$ kG and the large-scale field is dipolar and axisymmetric, with an average strength of 800 G. For StKM 1-1262, we found a strong anti-correlation between the total magnetic field and the effective temperature which is reminiscent of the tight link between small-scale magnetic fields and surface inhomogeneities. For V374 Peg, we found a moderate anti-correlation, possibly due to a more even distribution of surface features. (Abridged)

Abstract: Stars predominantly form in compact, non-hierarchical clusters. The gas outflows ejected by protostars can intersect and interact with each other, resulting in complex interactions that affect the dynamics, morphology, and evolution of these outflows. Determining the probability of an encounter between them requires a Bayesian approach that considers the collimation, length (or age), and separation between young stellar objects in the clusters. In this study, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to estimate this probability as a function of the jet opening angle and the ratio between the jet length and the separation between stars. We propose a function that predicts the number of interactions within a cluster based on the opening angle of the gas outflows ejected by protostars.
