Grand", "Martin Roth"], "title": "The Nature of Galactic Spiral Arms", "comment": "Submitted to the ESO call for White Papers", "summary": "Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies."}

White paper submitted to ESO Expanding Horizons call", "summary": "Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter."}

White paper submitted to ESO Expanding Horizons call", "summary": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures.

Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data."}

Thanks to their luminosity, the most distant known QSOs allow us to trace the growth of SMBHs deep into the epoch of reionisation. In this work, we employed $JWST$/NIRSpec observations of eight luminous (log$(L_{3000\\,A^{\\circ}}/(erg \\, s^{-1}))>$45.7) QSOs at $z\\geq$5.9 to constrain their accretion properties, namely black hole mass, accretion disc (AD) luminosity, and Eddington ratio ($M_{BH}$, $L_{AD}$, $λ_{Edd}$), by fitting the rest-frame UV and optical emission with different AD models. This method provided self-consistent measurements of both $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$. The uncertainties on $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$, obtained within the AD-modelling framework ($σ^{AD}_{M_{BH}}\\sim$0.2 dex; $σ^{AD}_{L_{AD}}\\sim$0.1 dex), are significantly smaller than the systematic uncertainties associated with single-epoch $M_{BH}$ ($\\sim$0.4 dex) and $L_{AD}$ derived via bolometric corrections ($\\sim$0.2 dex).

Assuming that our high-z QSOs are representative of optically-selected bright blue QSOs, we derive a fraction of systems accreting above the Eddington limit of $\\sim$0.2%. In conclusion, this work i) demonstrates the suitability of $JWST$ to test AD models on high-redshift ($z\\gtrsim$4) QSOs, thanks to the large NIRSpec spectral coverage; ii) shows that AD modelling can yield robust $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L_{\\rm AD}$ measurements, with smaller uncertainties than the typical calibrations; and iii) provides compelling evidence for sub-Eddington accretion in bright high-$z$ QSOs, challenging the widespread paradigm of near- or super-Eddington accretion occurring in these sources."}

This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are determined by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. Based on that, and using evolutionary tracks, the IS crossing times are computed. Results. We obtained the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands and in the HR diagram, and detected breaks at periods between 1.4 and 3 days. A comparison with existing theoretical models showed good agreement for the blue edge and significant differences for the red edge. We also found that the IS of the SMC is wider than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with its red edge being redder despite its lower metallicity. The analysis of crossing times showed that the expected number of Cepheids as a function of period agrees with the observed distribution for P > 1 days but differs for P < 1 days. Conclusions. Slope changes along the SMC IS borders are most likely explained by the distribution of metallicity. The behavior of the blue loops at the SMC metallicity is not consistent with observations, and at the LMC metallicity, the blue loops are too short for lower-mass stars. A comparison of theoretical edges with our empirical ISs imposes constraints on the models and enables the identification of valid ones. Based on the positions of the breaks, our study also suggests that fundamental-mode Cepheids with periods longer than 3 days should be used for distance determination."}

Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case.

Early in its history, Jupiter was more luminous and may have driven substantial atmospheric escape on Io and Europa. We investigate whether Io could have lost its water inventory while Europa retained its volatiles, assuming both moons initially accreted hydrous silicates. The formation and early thermal evolution of the protosatellites are modeled using an interior evolution model coupled with an atmospheric escape framework. Dehydration timescales and volatile losses for Io and Europa are computed during their early evolution, accounting for accretional heating from both satellitesimal and pebble accretion, as well as irradiation from Jupiter's primordial luminosity. Europa likely retained most of its volatiles under nearly all plausible formation and evolution scenarios, as large-scale dehydration would have taken place only after the first 10 Myr of its evolution. In contrast, Io was unlikely to lose a substantial amount of water through atmospheric escape and therefore probably accreted predominantly anhydrous silicates. If Europa initially accreted hydrous minerals, the present-day volatile contrast between Io and Europa could be explained by their relative locations with respect to the phyllosilicate dehydration line in the Jovian subnebula. Distinct evolutionary pathways or atmospheric escape processes alone appear insufficient to reproduce the observed differences."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics."}

High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity.

To make transformative progress on these questions we must characterize the physical and kinematic properties (integrated and spatially resolved) of stellar populations in galaxies, fossil record of their past star formation and assembly histories, together with gas properties, across a wide range of masses and environmental scales, over this critical cosmic epoch.

However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\\odot$ up to $3\\times 10^{-11}$\\,M$_\\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk.

Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies."}

However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5--4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\\sim$ 50--70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments."}

Based on this improved framework, a sample of 46,176 galaxies at $0<z<4.2$, selected in the COSMOS-Web field, is classified into five types using the JWST near-infrared images: 33\\% spherical (SPH), 25\\% early-type disk (ETD), 25\\% late-type disk (LTD), 7\\% irregular (IRR), and 10\\% unclassified (UNC) galaxies.

The analysis of morphological parameters is consistent with our classification system: SPH and ETD galaxies with higher $n$, $G$, and $C$ tend to be more bulge-dominated and more compact compared with other types of galaxies.

Cycle 25 is now entering its declining phase, the critical period during which most of the cycle's polar fields are established. Therefore, reliable polar-field prediction is now especially important. Polar-field evolution is governed by the poleward transport of already-emerged active-region (AR) flux over a timescale of a few years. Thus, surface flux-transport models can reliably provide one-year predictions without requiring information about future AR emergence. Our prediction method is validated using simulations of the surface magnetic field from 2020-2025 and hindcasts of the 2023-2024 polar fields, employing a newly constrained profile of the meridional flow. Using the most recent HMI synoptic magnetogram as the initial condition, we predict the polar-field evolution from October 2025 to October 2026. The southern polar field is predicted to strengthen gradually, while the northern field is expected to decline sharply until March 2026 due to some ARs with abnormal polarity. By that time, the northern polar field becomes exceptionally weak, and the southern field remains relatively weak, raising concerns about the polar-field strength at the cycle 25/26 minimum and the amplitude of cycle 26."}

In this context, the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) -- a collaborative global infrastructure comprising multiple regional centres distributed across various geographical regions around the globe -- is poised to play a critical role. This network will be instrumental in facilitating the effective handling and analysis of extensive data streams generated by the telescopes, thereby enabling significant advancements in astronomical research and exploration. This paper introduces a semantic model implemented with JSON-LD designed specifically for the SRCNet, detailing its architecture, data distribution, and computing service. By explicitly defining nodes, resources, relationships, and workflows, this model lays a foundation for interoperability and efficient resource management within the distributed network. The model presented in this text supports two possible configurations: centralized and decentralized -- depending where data reside -- enabling a future service broker to efficiently plan workflows by querying nodes for real-time system availability. Consistency tests conducted using SPARQL queries were made on the model in order to validate and test its integrity. Therefore, this research contributes to the advancement of semantic modeling in astronomy by addressing the semantic model for the SRCNet, a topic that has not been previously explored. This semantic model serves as a precursor to the development of a precise mathematical representation of the network and establishes a foundational framework for a future service broker."}

Outstanding questions include the role of collisions in depleting meteoroids on highly evolved orbits and the relative importance of delivery resonances. Those depend on size, with current dynamical models considering only asteroids larger than 10m in diameter. Based on 1,202 sporadic meteoroids observed by the Global Fireball Observatory, we created a debiased model of the near-Earth meteoroid population in the 10g - 150kg in size (approximately 1cm - 0.5m) as they dynamically evolved from the main asteroid belt onto Earth-crossing orbits. The observed impact population is best matched with a collisional half-life decreasing from 3Myr for meteoroids of 0.6kg (7cm) or higher, to 1Myr below this size, extending to the model lower bound of 10g. Placing our results in context with near-Earth object models for larger sizes, we find that the inner main belt continues to dominate feeding the small 1m to 10m diameter population primarily via the $ν_6$ secular resonance and the 3:1J mean motion resonance. We also evaluated the potential significance of physical processes other than collisions on Earth-impacting meteoroids, such as low-perihelion disruptions from thermal stresses."}

Their statistical properties such as number densities and luminosity functions are still uncertain because of small sample sizes and large cosmic variance. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with its large volume, offers an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We describe our LAB selection method and present 112 new LABs in the 9 deg$^2$ E-COSMOS field. We begin with the conventional LAB selection approach, cross-matching LAEs with extended Ly$α$ sources, yielding 89 LAB candidates. To obtain a more complete LAB sample, we introduce a new selection pipeline that models all galaxies detected in deep broadband imaging, subtracts them from the narrowband image, and then directly detects extended Ly$α$ emission. This method successfully identifies 23 additional low-surface-brightness LABs which could otherwise be missed by the conventional method. The number density of ODIN LABs near an ODIN protocluster ($n=7.5\\times10^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is comparable to that found in the SSA22 proto-cluster and is four times higher than the average across the field. The cumulative Ly$α$ luminosity function within the protocluster regions is similar to that measured for the LABs in the SSA22 proto-cluster, suggesting a large excess of luminous LABs relative to the average field. These findings suggest the Ly$α$ luminosities and number densities of LABs are environment-dependent. ODIN will provide an expansive LAB and protocluster samples across six additional fields and two more redshifts, allowing us to investigate the nature of LABs in relation to their environments."}

The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\\langle D\\rangle = 0.61 \\pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\\circ$-20$^\\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap.

Suspected to be the deflagrations of white dwarfs, they directly link the final stages of low-mass binary star evolution to extragalactic studies that are critical for cosmology. The ability to detect and study uTSNe is limited by the lack of high spatial resolution (<0.1\"), wide-field (>10'x10') imaging capabilities in the optical, as well as large-scale segmented-telescope spectroscopic abilities that allow highly dynamic time-critical spectroscopy of short-duration transient events. Neither capability is currently foreseen for the European Southern Observatory and is therefore an excellent candidate for the Expanding Horizons program."}

To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \\rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods."}

The relative influence of these two processes is still debated in groups compared to clusters, as ram pressure is less understood there. We study NGC 2276, a nearby galaxy (z$\\sim$0.0079) where the dominant process is still an open question. We examine the distribution of stellar populations in NGC 2276 using multiwavelength data to assess potential evidence of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping. We present the first HST WFC3/UVIS images of NGC 2276, and use them to investigate the distribution of stellar populations across the disk of NGC 2276, where we assume that the bluer broadband filters mainly trace younger stellar populations, while the redder filters trace mainly older stellar populations. Furthermore, by comparing HST images with maps of H$α$ emission from Calar Alto's PMAS/PPAK integral field unit (IFU) and near-IR maps from Spitzer's IRAC, we identify arm-like overdensity features that trace the spiral structure of this galaxy and tracked the variation of their pitch angle with radius. Our results indicate that the distribution of the stellar populations is asymmetrical. The youngest stellar populations (up to $\\sim$100 Myr) show higher concentration on the leading side of the galaxy and are more diffuse on the trailing side, consistent with gas compression due to ram-pressure. This asymmetry is visible in the red filters as well. We also show that the average pitch angles of the overdensity features increase with galactocentric distance. Our findings are consistent with the fact that ram pressure is the leading mechanism for the peculiar morphology of NGC 2276, but do not exclude the possibility that tidal interactions could have played a role."}

By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties.

SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases.

After compelling examples have been provided on multi-Shack-Hartman (SH) wave-front sensor (WFS) adaptive optics systems performing atmospheric tomography with laser guide star probes, we broaden the SR concept to pyramid sensors (PyWFS) with a single sensor and a natural guide star. We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper.

However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\\odot$ up to $3\\times 10^{-11}$\\,M$_\\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars."}

A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $<1\\%$, or $\\sim 2.6 σ$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin."}

In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources."}

This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $μ$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Globular clusters (GCs), densely packed collections of thousands to millions of old stars, are excellent tracers of their host galaxies' evolutionary histories. Traditional methods for identifying GCs in galaxies rely on cuts over photometric catalogs and can yield source lists with high levels of contamination from compact background galaxies and foreground stars. In an era when large-scale sky surveys produce photometry for millions of sources, it is essential to employ flexible and scalable tools to reliably identify GCs in external galaxies. To prepare for surveys like Rubin/LSST, we need to explore practical methodological improvements and quantify the limitations inherent in the datasets. This paper investigates the selection of point-like extragalactic GCs exclusively in the $ugrizY$ color space. We use archival data to assemble an LSST-like photometric catalog for the Fornax Cluster containing labeled spectroscopically confirmed GCs, galaxies, and stars. From this catalog, using principal component analysis and non-linear auto-encoders (AEs), we construct inputs to random forest and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. We show that selecting GCs using ugrizY colors can lead to contamination rates of ~ 45%. If the principal components of the colors are used instead, this rate reduces to ~ 35% without increasing incompleteness. The AEs did not improve GC identification. To further reduce contamination and extract the full potential of LSST for star cluster studies, we argue for the need to augment photometric information with ancillary data (morphology from space-based missions and near-infrared photometry) before attempting to leverage more complex models."}

In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes."}

By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($λ_{\\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($λ_{\\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $λ_{\\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $λ_{\\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\\rm h}\\sim 10^{11} \\rm M_{\\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $λ_{\\rm a}$ but small $λ_{\\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($Σ_\\ast$) of a galaxy to $λ_{\\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $Λ$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos.

These observed loops are in turn structured into bright strands. We investigate the relationship between magnetic field geometry, plasma properties and bright strands with the help of a 3D resistive MHD simulation of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistent convection zone layer. We find that it is impossible to identify a loop as a simple coherent magnetic flux tube that coincides with plasma of nearly uniform temperature and density. The location of bright structures is determined by a complex interplay between heating, cooling and evaporation timescales. Current sheets form preferentially at the interfaces of magnetic flux from different sources. They may also form within bundles of magnetic field lines since motions within magnetic concentrations drive plasma flows on a range of timescales that provide further substructure and can locally enhance magnetic field gradients and thus facilitate magnetic reconnection. The numerical experiment therefore possesses aspects of both the flux tube tectonics and flux braiding models. While modelling an observed coronal loop as a cylindrical flux tube is useful to understand the physics of specific heating mechanisms in isolation, it does not describe well the structure of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistently evolving convection zone."}

Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data."}

Presently, the empirical correlation lacks sufficient precision to confidently convert these timescales into black hole masses, especially at the low-mass end. To find more AGNs with timescale measurements, we study a very large catalog of AGNs from the Gaia Data Release 3 called GLEAN (Gaia variabLE AgN; 872228 objects). We identify GLEAN objects with optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 and light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR21. After fitting the light curves with a damped random walk model, we find that the GLEAN light curves have insufficient sampling to extract reliable amplitude and timescale measurements outside the range of 50-100 days. On the other hand, well-sampled ZTF light curves allow more accurate estimations of these parameters. The fractional variability amplitude is an effective, model-independent metric for measuring variability amplitude, but only when derived from high-quality light curves. We provide a catalog of 127 GLEAN AGNs with spectroscopic virial black hole masses, and variability amplitudes and timescales. Though we do not find any low-mass black holes in this AGN sample, we confirm a relationship between the damped random walk timescale and the black hole mass that is consistent with previous studies."}

Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter."}

We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes.

This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies."}

This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are determined by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. Based on that, and using evolutionary tracks, the IS crossing times are computed. Results. We obtained the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands and in the HR diagram, and detected breaks at periods between 1.4 and 3 days. A comparison with existing theoretical models showed good agreement for the blue edge and significant differences for the red edge. We also found that the IS of the SMC is wider than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with its red edge being redder despite its lower metallicity. The analysis of crossing times showed that the expected number of Cepheids as a function of period agrees with the observed distribution for P > 1 days but differs for P < 1 days. Conclusions. Slope changes along the SMC IS borders are most likely explained by the distribution of metallicity. The behavior of the blue loops at the SMC metallicity is not consistent with observations, and at the LMC metallicity, the blue loops are too short for lower-mass stars. A comparison of theoretical edges with our empirical ISs imposes constraints on the models and enables the identification of valid ones. Based on the positions of the breaks, our study also suggests that fundamental-mode Cepheids with periods longer than 3 days should be used for distance determination."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics."}

What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies."}

By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time."}

This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $μ$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid."}

In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources."}
