Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$α$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$λ$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$α$ emission line with luminosity $\\log L_{\\rm Lyα}=42.49\\pm0.01~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$λ$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution."}

Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling."}

These so-called \"little red dots\" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times."}

We find that the optimal frequency range for achieving cyclic deconvolution for most pulsars is between $\\sim$80$-$300 MHz, making low frequency observatories like uGMRT, LOFAR, and MWA the best-suited instruments for the technique. Moreover, we find that, as quantified by the total number sources with sufficient cyclic merits that are observed within the full deconvolution regime, uGMRT is likely the best current instrument for cyclic spectroscopy among the nine telescopes we considered, with LOFAR being the second best, and future telescopes like SKA-Low serving as the most likely eventual successors. The relatively high cyclic merit of the Crab Pulsar in the frequency ranges considered for GBT, MWA, LOFAR, and uGMRT suggests that some faster-spinning canonical pulsars may be able to achieve cyclic deconvolution, and we discuss potential follow-up analyses on other non-recycled pulsars. We conclude by advocating for near real-time cyclic spectroscopy backends to be considered for current and upcoming low frequency telescopes to increase the accessibility of this technique."}

ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects.

Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR."}

Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$σ$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) < 1.7 \\times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) < 1.1 \\times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively.

Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \\propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$.

Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\\left(\\vec{x},\\vec{v}\\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\\left(\\vec{v}\\mid\\vec{x}\\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function.

We demonstrate that this \"conditional\" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function.

We use KORG, a state of the art spectral synthesis package, to derive 1D-LTE abundances from high-SNR and high-resolution spectra taken by the Large Binocular Telescope with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument. These precise spectra and abundance measurements minimize the impact of photon-noise (<0.06 dex), allowing us to robustly measure the intrinsic abundance scatter in [X/Fe]. After removing two stars with exceptional s-process enhancement, we find that the intrinsic scatter among the s- and r-process elements tends to be larger than for the lighter elements, with heavy element scatter ranging from 0.11 (Zn) to 0.27 (Eu) dex. Intrinsic abundance scatter could have multiple origins, including star-to-star variations in the ratios of nucleosynthetic sources as well as stochastic sampling of the progenitor supernovae properties, such as mass, rotation, and magnetic field strength. We explore the expected abundance scatter signature caused by stochastic sampling, finding that a fraction of both rapidly rotating CCSN and magnetorotationally driven SN are needed to reach the observed abundances and intrinsic scatter. This analysis is limited by the restrictive parameter spaces spanned by existing yield sets. A diverse, finely sampled grid of supernovae yields is needed to robustly model stochastic abundance scatter."}

These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45--55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood."}

Motivated by the challenge, we developed Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS), a new algorithm that simultaneously fits planetary transits and background trends using a segmented double polynomial model. Prior to signal detection, the optimal polynomial order for the trend component is selected using Bayes factor-based model comparison. During the periodogram search, the Signal Detection Efficiency metric is used to assess signal significance. The algorithm is accelerated by a three-step approximation and nonlinear parameter sampling tailored to SPLS. We compare the performance of SPLS with traditional detrending-detection approaches across different orbital periods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), planet radii and stellar noise levels on an injection-recovery test. When detecting signals with periods between 10 and 480 days and SNRs below 9, SPLS achieves at least a 22.6% higher true positive rate than other methods at the same 10% false positive rate. Using the threshold determined from the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, our method also recovers the most true signals while yielding the fewest false positives among all injected samples, and reaches a 97% recovery fraction in Kepler confirmed single-planet systems. The tests demonstrate that SPLS improves the detection of transiting planets, particularly for low-SNR, long-period signals. It offers the potential for finding Earth twins in future applications to data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming PLATO and Earth 2.0 missions."}

To trigger ZLK oscillations, however, a 3-body system must reach a sufficiently large mutual inclination between orbits. The occurrence of these high-mutual-inclination configurations can be curtailed by dissipative precession at the protoplanetary disk stage, which pushes exoplanet-hosting close binary systems toward preferential orbit-orbit alignment. In this work, we constrain the fraction of white dwarfs with binary companions that can undergo ZLK-driven pollution given the effects of dissipative precession. To accrete pollution via ZLK oscillations, a white dwarf binary system must be sufficiently inclined and the characteristic timescale of the oscillations must be sufficiently short to perturb material within the white dwarf's cooling age. Considering a sample of 4400 known white dwarf/main sequence binaries, we find that $50-70\\%$ have favorable parameters for ZLK pollution, depending on the orbital separation of the polluting body. While the conditions for oscillations are favorable, the tendency for ZLK to result in massive but more infrequent polluters likely restricts the rates of ZLK-induced pollution among the observed population. In general, dissipative precession is a limiting factor in pollution rates for more closely separated binaries (initial separations $<500-800$~au), while ZLK timescale constraints are most limiting for wider binaries."}

These four galaxies span a wide range of environments and evolutionary states. Hydrus A (MV = -9.39+/-0.20, D = 3.38-0.30+0.32 Mpc) and LEDA 486718 (MV = -11.62+/-0.08, D = 4.80+/-0.17 Mpc) are among the most isolated dwarfs known within 5 Mpc, while Cetus B (MV = -8.26+/-0.17, D = 3.32-0.23+0.25 Mpc) and Sculptor 26 (MV = -11.25+/-0.10, D =3.21+/-0.13 Mpc) lie < 2 Rvir of NGC 253. Hydrus A shows properties consistent with quenching driven by cosmic reionization, cosmic-web interactions, or internal feedback. LEDA 486718 is an isolated star forming dwarf. Cetus B appears quenched and morphologically disturbed, making it a low-mass satellite or backsplash candidate, while Sculptor 26 is red and seemingly gas-poor but displays signs of recent activity, consistent with a transitional evolutionary state. Together, these systems demonstrate the power of SEAMLESS for building a census of faint galaxies beyond the Local Group."}

This paper studies the dynamic evolution of streamers and pseudostreamers with a particular focus on the release of plasma from the closed to the open field region. We employ a global magnetohydrodynamic model that extends from the solar chromosphere to 30 solar radii, and that extends previous interchange magnetic reconnection modelling by including self-consistent thermodynamics. We find that at both the helmet streamer and pseudostreamer there is a continual dynamic interaction between closed and open flux. At the helmet streamer, this takes the form of a ''breathing'' cycle in which the closed flux contracts and expands, and plasmoids are released along the heliospheric current sheet. The pseudostreamer exhibits a back-and-forth motion, driving interchange reconnection alternately on its opposite flanks. The resulting release of hot, dense plasma leads to density fluctuations in the open field that are significantly larger above the helmet streamer due to the persistence of the plasmoids there. Our model demonstrates that plasma is continually being released into the heliosphere from both streamers and pseudostreamers."}

Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of <5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a >13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (<1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0).

Motivated by the challenge, we developed Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS), a new algorithm that simultaneously fits planetary transits and background trends using a segmented double polynomial model. Prior to signal detection, the optimal polynomial order for the trend component is selected using Bayes factor-based model comparison. During the periodogram search, the Signal Detection Efficiency metric is used to assess signal significance. The algorithm is accelerated by a three-step approximation and nonlinear parameter sampling tailored to SPLS. We compare the performance of SPLS with traditional detrending-detection approaches across different orbital periods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), planet radii and stellar noise levels on an injection-recovery test. When detecting signals with periods between 10 and 480 days and SNRs below 9, SPLS achieves at least a 22.6% higher true positive rate than other methods at the same 10% false positive rate. Using the threshold determined from the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, our method also recovers the most true signals while yielding the fewest false positives among all injected samples, and reaches a 97% recovery fraction in Kepler confirmed single-planet systems. The tests demonstrate that SPLS improves the detection of transiting planets, particularly for low-SNR, long-period signals. It offers the potential for finding Earth twins in future applications to data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming PLATO and Earth 2.0 missions."}

We compare the accretion rate of the younger intermediate-mass T Tauri stars (IMTTSs) with the older Herbig stars into which they evolve. We find that the median accretion rate of IMTTSs (1.2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly lower than that of Herbig stars (1.9$\\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). This increase stands in stark contrast with canonical models of disk evolution that predict that the stellar accretion rate declines with age. We put forward a physically plausible scenario that accounts for the systematic increase of stellar accretion based on the increase of the effective temperature of the stars as they evolve towards the zero-age main sequence. For example, the temperature of a 2M$_{\\odot}$ star will increase from 4900~K in the IMTTS phase to 9100~K during the Herbig phase. Thus, the luminosity of the far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation will increase by orders of magnitude. We propose that this increase drives a higher stellar accretion rate. The scenario we propose to account for the increase in the stellar accretion rate solves the lifetime problem for Herbig disks because the increasing stellar accretion rates require lower initial disk masses to account for present-day disk masses. This work highlights the importance of the role FUV radiation has in driving the accretion rate, predicts a large population of pre-main-sequence non-accreting A stars, and has implications for interpreting disk morphologies that may serve as signposts of embedded gas giant planets in Herbig disks."}

In general, planets with a composition close to chemical equilibrium have smaller abundance uncertainties than planets whose composition is dominated by photochemistry. Some molecules, such as H2O, CO, CO2, and SiO, show low abundance uncertainties, while others such as HCN, SO2, PH3, and TiO have more uncertain abundances. We identified several critical albeit poorly constrained processes involving S-, P-, Si-, and Ti-bearing species whose better characterization should lead to a global improvement in the accuracy of models.

Although such perturbations arise naturally within $Λ$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\\%$ and $ 12\\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case.

Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs."}

Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation."}

We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\\approx$7$σ$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track.

We find that the velocity dispersion ratio between Cra2 stream and galaxy ($2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.35}$) is difficult to reconcile with a cuspy halo with fiducial concentration and an initial mass predicted by standard stellar mass$-$halo mass relationships. Instead, either a cored halo with relatively small core radius or a low-concentration cuspy model can reproduce this ratio.

Other diffuse dwarf galaxies similar to Cra2 in the Local Group (Antlia 2 and Andromeda 19) also challenge galaxy formation models.

However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at $z=5.65$, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 ($λ_\\mathrm{rest}=50μ$m) and Band 4 ($300μ$m) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data ($70-200μ$m) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the $3.4-4.0σ$ level, and measure a dust temperature of $T_\\mathrm{dust} = 37_{-5}^{+6}$K and dust mass $\\log(M_\\mathrm{dust}/M_\\odot) = 8.0 \\pm 0.1$. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H$_2$ and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to $α_\\mathrm{[CII]}^\\mathrm{ISM} = 39^{+50}_{-25}M_\\odot L_\\odot^{-1}$. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples."}

While magnetic flux emergence and cancellation are widely recognized as key contributors to jet formation, the mechanisms behind repeated magnetic reconnection remain poorly understood. In this letter, we report a sequence of nine recurrent jets originating from active region AR 12715 during its decay phase, where the jet activity was associated with a complex distribution of fragmented magnetic flux. Non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations reveal the presence of low-lying, current-carrying loops beneath overarching open magnetic fields near the jet footpoints. These magnetic structures were perturbed by (i) emerging flux elements and (ii) interactions between oppositely polarized moving magnetic features (MMFs). To interpret these observations, we compare them with 3D radiative MHD simulation from the Bifrost model, which reproduce jet formation driven by interacting bipolar MMFs, leading to subsequent flux cancellation in the photosphere. Our results emphasize the critical role of MMF-driven flux interactions in initiating and sustaining recurrent jet activity in active regions."}

Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs."}

The proportion of inward/outward jets depends on heliocentric distance, and the main HCS reconnection X-line has a higher probability of being located close to the Alfvén surface. We also observe a radial asymmetry in jet acceleration, where inward jets do not reach the local Alfvén speed, contrary to outward jets. We find that turbulence levels are enhanced in the ion kinetic range, consistent with the triggering of an inverse cascade by magnetic reconnection. Finally, we highlight the ubiquity of magnetic hole trains in the high $β$ environment of the HCS, showing that the mirror mode instability plays a key role in regulating the ion temperature anisotropy in HCS reconnection. Our findings shed new light on the properties of magnetic reconnection in the high $β$ plasma environment of the HCS, its interplay with the turbulent cascade and the role of the mirror mode instability."}

We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected for 15 G-M type stars with Neo-Narval, HARPSpol, and SPIRou to assess the detectability of the large-scale magnetic field. For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\\rm\\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfvénic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfvénic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfvénic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfvénic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfvénic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field."}

Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\\rm C_T=0.45\\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\\rm C_T=0.66\\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\\rm i=50^\\circ\\pm^{8^\\circ}_{9^\\circ}$ and $\\rm i=13^\\circ\\pm^{7^\\circ}_{6^\\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas."}

The combination of EUV and X-ray images and X-ray spectra allowed us to identify hot loops in the vicinity of the filament before its eruption. We interpreted their interaction with the rising filament as a signature of an arcade-to-rope reconnection geometry. The subsequent EUV brightening within the filament revealed helical structure of the erupting rope. We explained co-temporal radio slowly positively drifting bursts as a result of beam acceleration within the magnetic rope and propagation along the helical structure. Corresponding X-ray spectra were consistent with a thermal origin. The filament rising was accompanied by co-temporal normal and reverse drift type III radio bursts. We interpreted them as a signature of a reconnection event and estimated electron density at the reconnection site. Further untwisting of the helical structure led to formation of a quasi-circular EUV structure seen from Earth and STEREO-A. Its occurrence was co-temporal with a unique tangle of radio U- and inverse U-bursts. We proposed that several accelerated beams propagate within that complex structure and generate the burst tangle. During the start of the flare hard X-ray emission was concentrated near the filament leg only suggesting predominant propagation of the beams towards its rooting. We collected multi-wavelength observations indicating interaction of the erupting magnetic flux rope with the overlying arcade and internal magnetic reconnection inside the rising flux rope."}

We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements."}

We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes.

A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit."}

Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We update the status of the spectropolarimetric campaign dedicated to characterise the magnetic field properties of a sample of known exoplanet-hosting stars included in the current target list of the $Ariel$ mission. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected for 15 G-M type stars with Neo-Narval, HARPSpol, and SPIRou to assess the detectability of the large-scale magnetic field. For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\\rm\\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfvénic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfvénic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfvénic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfvénic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfvénic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field."}

We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\\dotω$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system."}

Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of <5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a >13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (<1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0). Some Class II and III objects appear to be already decoupling."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "In dense environments, mechanisms like ram pressure stripping (RPS) and gravitational interactions can induce similar morphological features in galaxies, distinguishable only through detailed study of their stellar properties. While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t < 20 Myr and 20 Myr <= t < 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys."}

In this work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform label transfer, wherein we use the GALAH DR4 spectra and stellar parameters to infer DR3 [Eu/H] abundances. This CNN is then applied to DR4 spectra without corresponding DR3 Eu abundances to develop a new, publicly available catalogue of [Eu/H] values for high signal-to-noise targets.

In order to maximize the signal of these absorption lines, we have selected a sample of 238,838 quasar spectra from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), each identified to have absorption lines resulting from such an interaction. By stacking these spectra in the restframe of the absorption, and calculating a median composite spectrum, we are able to isolate and enhance these absorption lines. We provide a full atlas of all detected absorption and emission lines as well as their fit centroids and equivalent width values.

To trigger ZLK oscillations, however, a 3-body system must reach a sufficiently large mutual inclination between orbits. The occurrence of these high-mutual-inclination configurations can be curtailed by dissipative precession at the protoplanetary disk stage, which pushes exoplanet-hosting close binary systems toward preferential orbit-orbit alignment. In this work, we constrain the fraction of white dwarfs with binary companions that can undergo ZLK-driven pollution given the effects of dissipative precession. To accrete pollution via ZLK oscillations, a white dwarf binary system must be sufficiently inclined and the characteristic timescale of the oscillations must be sufficiently short to perturb material within the white dwarf's cooling age. Considering a sample of 4400 known white dwarf/main sequence binaries, we find that $50-70\\%$ have favorable parameters for ZLK pollution, depending on the orbital separation of the polluting body. While the conditions for oscillations are favorable, the tendency for ZLK to result in massive but more infrequent polluters likely restricts the rates of ZLK-induced pollution among the observed population. In general, dissipative precession is a limiting factor in pollution rates for more closely separated binaries (initial separations $<500-800$~au), while ZLK timescale constraints are most limiting for wider binaries."}

Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_ν$, up to 0.5$μ$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines.

This excess increases to 91$\\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$μ$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$μ$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$μ$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$μ$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths."}

Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation."}

These precise spectra and abundance measurements minimize the impact of photon-noise (<0.06 dex), allowing us to robustly measure the intrinsic abundance scatter in [X/Fe]. After removing two stars with exceptional s-process enhancement, we find that the intrinsic scatter among the s- and r-process elements tends to be larger than for the lighter elements, with heavy element scatter ranging from 0.11 (Zn) to 0.27 (Eu) dex. Intrinsic abundance scatter could have multiple origins, including star-to-star variations in the ratios of nucleosynthetic sources as well as stochastic sampling of the progenitor supernovae properties, such as mass, rotation, and magnetic field strength. We explore the expected abundance scatter signature caused by stochastic sampling, finding that a fraction of both rapidly rotating CCSN and magnetorotationally driven SN are needed to reach the observed abundances and intrinsic scatter. This analysis is limited by the restrictive parameter spaces spanned by existing yield sets. A diverse, finely sampled grid of supernovae yields is needed to robustly model stochastic abundance scatter."}
