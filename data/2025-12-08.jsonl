We find that there is a decreasing correlation with redshift (Spearman correlation $r_S=-0.604$, p-value $=9\\times10^{-10}$), however this can be plausibly accounted for by including the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and the passive aging of stellar populations.

But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy."}

Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff."}

For planets orbiting rapidly rotating, and consequently oblate, host stars, photometric light curves provide a unique opportunity to measure the spin-orbit angle. Moreover, in systems with significant spin-orbit misalignment, the stellar oblateness can induce observable orbital precession. We wish to study the atmosphere and orbital architecture of an ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, orbiting around a hot A-type star. We use the photometric phase curves and gravity-darkened transits of WASP-189 b observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), complemented with the archival observations from CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). We detected a phase curve signal with significant occultation depth of 203.4 (+16.2) (-16.3) ppm, while the nightside flux, -71.8 (+36.4) (-36.0) ppm, is consistent with zero at 2-sigma. We invert the phase curve signal to construct the temperature map of the planet. The map was subsequently used to estimate the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency, the expected median ranges of which are found to be 0.19-0.35 and 0.09-0.41, respectively. Finally, we analysed gravity-darkened transits to find that the planet is in polar orbit with the spin-orbit angle of 89.46 (+1.08) (-1.08) deg. We found no hint of orbital precession while comparing our results with those from the literature. Our observations, together with atmospheric modelling, suggest that the dayside emission of WASP-189 b in TESS and CHEOPS bandpasses is dominated by thermal emission from an atmosphere with extremely inefficient heat transport and negligible contribution from reflected light."}

This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data."}

We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $χ^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \\sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey."}

Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source."}

Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*<10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs."}

The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion.

From simulations to sky: Advancing machine-learning lens detection with real Euclid data", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST."}

We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \\approx 1$ to $z \\approx 10$. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \\ion{Mg}{2} $λ\\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \\ion{Mg}{2} absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, increasing from $\\sim 1$~Å at $M_* \\approx 10^9~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ to over $3$~Å at $M_* > 10^{10.5}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \\lesssim 10^{9.5}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), high-redshift ($z > 3$) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at $z > 3$. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "The slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are a class of variable star with masses between about 3 and 8 M$_{\\odot}$. Their gravity-mode pulsation frequencies are sensitive to the near-core structure, which makes them useful probes of rotation and mixing in the deep stellar interior. Time series photometry, such as from the Kepler and TESS space telescopes, allows the extraction of their pulsation frequencies and construction of period spacing patterns. Previously, samples of slowly pulsating B stars were observed by the Kepler mission and underwent forward asteroseismic modelling to retrieve stellar parameters such as mass, age and core mass. However, all of these stars have since been re-observed by the ongoing TESS mission with light curves that are usually shorter and non-continuous, resulting in more difficult frequency extraction and interpretation in terms of constructing period spacing patterns. In this paper we compare the results of forward asteroseismic modelling of a sample of SPB stars using intermittent TESS light curve data to those based on long-duration Kepler light curves. We show how in some cases that the masses and core masses derived from only a few sectors of TESS data agree well with the 4-yr Kepler mission results, despite the stars having far fewer significant pulsation frequencies in their TESS light curves. However, some stars yield incompatible results, emphasising the complexities in forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity-mode pulsators with sparsely sampled or short duration TESS light curves."}

The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will deliver some of the highest precision measurements of weak lensing ever made. Since weak lensing is based on statistics of faint sources, it can be biased by even tiny instrument systematics, including correlated read noise. Previous works have shown the infrared detectors used in the Roman WFI show correlations in their noise fields at a level significant for weak lensing measurements, even after application of standard reference pixel corrections; of particular concern is 1/f noise, which appears as horizontal banding in the detector frame. In this paper, we present imDestripe: a new Python module utilizing the multiple roll angles in Roman's observing strategy and linear algebra techniques to remove correlated noise stripes from observed images. We test imDestripe in a hybrid simulation by combining real noise realizations (from darks taken during ground testing) with simulated images of the astronomical scene, and find that the power spectrum of the banding can be suppressed by factors of 10--30 on large scales. We briefly discuss plans for further development of imDestripe in the context of the WFI pipeline."}

It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration."}

Precise geometric calibration is critical for this mission, particularly due to PolCam's highly oblique viewing geometry, which introduces significant topographic distortion. We present a comprehensive on-orbit geometric calibration that relies on 160,256 tie points derived from matching features between PolCam images and the well-orthorectified global map of the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). This dataset allows us to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the accurate reconstruction of the observation time for each line of an observation strip via a simple linear model, and (2) the refinement of the precise camera model, geometric model for PolCam optics. Our optimization method for these two challenges transforms the 2D image coordinates of identified features into 3D lunar coordinates and minimizes the reprojection error against the reference coordinates provided by the Kaguya MI map. From the refined observation time and camera model, we compute the precise longitude, latitude, and elevation of each pixel of an observed image. These estimated 3D coordinates are then used to generate orthorectified images, the final product of the geometric calibration. The resulting calibration achieves a geometric precision comparable to that of previous lunar orbiters and establishes the foundational framework necessary to produce geometrically-corrected data products of PolCam."}

We have found two faint ($Δ$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations.

We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution."}

We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $χ^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \\sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey."}

We find that pressure extrema consist of wave guides in which such topological modes propagate. The fundamental mode trapped at a pressure bump can propagate at all frequencies, allowing it to resonate with any temporal forcing, while the mode associated with a pressure gap propagates at a fixed frequency, propagates with arbitrary vertical phase velocity.

The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a \"thin plane\" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years."}

To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem."}

Precise geometric calibration is critical for this mission, particularly due to PolCam's highly oblique viewing geometry, which introduces significant topographic distortion. We present a comprehensive on-orbit geometric calibration that relies on 160,256 tie points derived from matching features between PolCam images and the well-orthorectified global map of the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). This dataset allows us to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the accurate reconstruction of the observation time for each line of an observation strip via a simple linear model, and (2) the refinement of the precise camera model, geometric model for PolCam optics. Our optimization method for these two challenges transforms the 2D image coordinates of identified features into 3D lunar coordinates and minimizes the reprojection error against the reference coordinates provided by the Kaguya MI map. From the refined observation time and camera model, we compute the precise longitude, latitude, and elevation of each pixel of an observed image. These estimated 3D coordinates are then used to generate orthorectified images, the final product of the geometric calibration. The resulting calibration achieves a geometric precision comparable to that of previous lunar orbiters and establishes the foundational framework necessary to produce geometrically-corrected data products of PolCam."}

One possibility is that sub-Neptunes have silicate/iron interiors and H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, i.e., they are `gas dwarfs'. If gas dwarfs have molten interiors, interactions between their magma oceans and atmospheres will produce distinct observational signatures. These signatures may break the degeneracy in interior structure, while providing insight into their interior processes, history, and population trends. We expect all such planets are born molten, but under what conditions do they remain molten today? We use the coupled interior-climate evolution model, PROTEUS, to estimate the `solidification shoreline': the instellation flux boundary (as a function of stellar $T_{\\rm eff}$) that separates molten gas dwarfs from solidified ones. Our results show that 98\\% of detected sub-Neptunes occupy a region of parameter space consistent with their having permanent magma oceans, if they are gas dwarfs. While mantle $f{\\rm O}_2$ and bulk volatile C/H ratio both influence magma ocean lifetimes, planets with oxidising mantles and carbon-rich atmospheres are unlikely to have radii consistent with the sub-Neptune classification. Therefore, most detected sub-Neptunes (if they are gas dwarfs) have permanent magma oceans. This result motivates further research into the interactions between molten interiors and overlying atmospheres, and campaigns to identify unambiguous signatures of these interactions."}

Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source."}

The ALMAGAL project observed $\\sim1000$ clumps at $\\sim$1000\\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $Λ_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\\sim2.2$, but $e\\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $λ^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\\approx3\\timesλ^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution."}

We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $χ^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \\sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey."}

Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($λ$=3.1 mm), 6 ($λ$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($λ$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms."}

Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data."}

This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data."}

Spectroscopic measurements of HD 33632 Ab now span 1-4 micron, and we perform the first spectroscopic analysis covering this full range. The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion. We find significant tension between the surface gravities and object radii inferred from atmosphere model fits and those predicted by evolutionary models. We conclude with a comparison to the spectra of the HR 8799 c, d, and e, and emphasize the case that HD 33632 Ab, and other L/T transition directly imaged companions with constrained masses, will serve an essential role in understanding the complex physical processes governing the appearance of clouds in planetary atmospheres."}

From simulations to sky: Advancing machine-learning lens detection with real Euclid data", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST."}
