Using photometric data from\nthe TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets\nwith post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on\nthe giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates,\nthirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of\n\\Ntotal\\ post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end\nof the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an\noccurrence rate of $0.28 \\pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting\npost-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar\nsub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \\pm 0.05$% for a sub-population\nrepresenting the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and\n$0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars.

Past works have suggested that a small fraction of them should\ncontract to a few stellar radii or collide, due to the co-operation of stellar\ntides and the eccentricity oscillations induced by the strong tidal field of\nthe central massive black hole. We revisit this model with several updates. We\nfirst argue that when a binary's pericenter separation is driven down to a few\nstellar radii, diffusive excitation of stellar tides should quickly contract\nthe orbit, saving the stars from collision. Instead, the stars should end up as\na very tight binary. We then show that vector resonant relaxation and\nperturbations from passing stars -- effects not included in past models --\ndramatically increase the prevalence of such encounters. In numerical\nexperiments, we find that 1 in 5 binaries around 1 pc from Sgr A* should\ntidally contract in this way while still on the main sequence.

Our methodology jointly fits broadband photometry\nand emission line fluxes. We apply six models to the Low-redshift LyC Survey\n(LzLCS), a sample of local galaxies with properties comparable to EoR galaxies,\nand evaluate them based on their ability to recover the observed LyC flux and\ntheir relative Bayesian evidence. The best-performing model is further assessed\nthrough a parameter recovery test, demonstrating that $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm\nLyC}$can be recovered within uncertainties. Building on these results, we\npresent updated $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ estimates for the LzLCS sample, with a\nmedian of 0.3%, corresponding to very low leakage, and values reaching as high\nas 70%, with six of 64 galaxies having a cosmologically relevant $f_{\\rm\nesc}^{\\rm LyC}$ ($>5%$). Additionally, we present a revised UV $\\beta$-slope vs\n$\\log_{10}(f_\\mathrm{esc}^\\mathrm{LyC})$ relation, derived using symbolic\nregression with PySR trained on a synthetic dataset generated from our\nbest-performing model: $\\log_{10}(f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}) = (-3.59\\beta - 9.45)\n\\, \\pm \\, 0.30$. The relation successfully reproduces the $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm\nLyC}$ obtained from full SED fitting of the LzLCS sample within uncertainties."}

The relative flux of impactors\narriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is\nenhanced by a factor of $\\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors\nalso arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally\nslower than objects in the overall population. This is because the\nEarth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity\nhyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing.\nEarth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits\nclose to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of\ninclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at\nlow/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher\nimpact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population\ntherefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and\nsinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring\nwhen the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general\nare more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the\ndirection of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the\nEarth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the\nNorthern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are\nindependent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and\nsize-frequency distribution and are publicly available."}

In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the\nbroad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion\ndisc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the\ndisc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation\nfrom the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended,\ndusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density--temperature\ndependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust\nabundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature\nscale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show\nthat such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas\ndensity raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust\nabundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using\nlocalised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our\nlinear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into\n``fountains'' of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation\npressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which\nsublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free\nclumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards\nthe disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions\n$\\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of\nthe Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the\nAGN broad-line region."}

This\nstudy aims to introduce and validate the grId of Stellar atmOSphere and\nhydrodynamiC modELs for massivE Stars (ISOSCELES), a grid-based framework for\nthe quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars. The project leverages\nhydrodynamic wind solutions derived from the m-CAK theory, including both fast\nand $\\delta$-slow solutions, to improve the accuracy of derived stellar and\nwind parameters. We constructed a comprehensive grid of models based on\nhydrodynamic wind solutions from the Hydwind code and synthetic spectral line\nprofiles generated by the Fastwind code. The grid spans a broad parameter space\ncovering OBA-type stars with solar metallicity. A semi-automatic fitting\nprocedure was developed to analyse key spectral lines and derive the stellar\nand wind parameters. Applying ISOSCELES to six stars demonstrates its ability\nto reproduce observed spectral profiles with high fidelity. The $\\delta$-slow\nsolution proved effective for two early-type B supergiants.

The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs)\nwill cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a\nfactor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an\nunprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)\nand constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um,\nEuclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number\ndensities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic\nphotometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15\ngalaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal\nselection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting\n(from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of\ninput z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%.

We find that those moons have a notably different likelihood of\nexistence (and, by implication, observability). Large moons orbiting Earth-like\nplanets in the HZs of M4 and M2 dwarfs become unstable well before $10^7$ and\n$10^8 \\textrm{ yr}$, respectively, and in most cases, those orbiting M0-dwarfs\nbecome unstable in much less than $10^9 \\textrm{ yr}$. We conclude that HZ\nplanets orbiting M-dwarfs are unlikely to harbor large moons, thus affecting\nthe total number of possible moons in our galaxy and the Universe at large.\nSince moons may help enhance the habitability of their host planet, besides\nbeing possibly habitable themselves, these results may have notable\nimplications for exolife, and should also be considered when seeking solutions\nto the Drake equation and the Fermi paradox."}

On 2023 March 13, a halo CME, as seen from the Solar Heliospheric\nObservatory (SoHO) and the Sun TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), gave\nrise to a strong SEP event. In this work, we aim to analyze this CME-driven\nshock from multiple spacecraft, using both remote sensing observations from\nSTEREO-A/COR2 and in-situ data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter\n(SolO), and Wind. In order to determine its direction of propagation and\nkinematic properties, we model the shock geometry using STEREO-A/COR2 and\nSoHO/LASCO/C3 observations as an expanding ellipsoid. The density compression\nratio of the shock is determined by fitting the brightness profile from the\ncoronagraphic images with that obtained from raytracing simulations of a\ndouble-Gaussian shock density profile. We compare physical quantities such as\ncompression ratio and Alfv\\'enic Mach number derived from remote sensing\nobservations with in-situ measurements by PSP, SolO, STEREO-A, and Wind. From\nSTEREO-A/COR2, we determine the compression ratio around the entire shock front\nin the corona, finding significant non-homogeneities that can impact the values\nfound during in-situ crossings. Following the evolution of the parameters\ncharacterizing the CME from the source to space, we find that closer to the\nSun, both the gas compression ratio and the Alfv\\'enic Mach number remain\nalmost constant, while they increase at larger radial distances.

In this paper, we aim to understand the link\nbetween these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies\nand their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the\nEuclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and\nphotometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in\nthe range 0.25<z<1 with $M_\\ast>10^{9.5} M_\\odot$. We divide the sample into\nfour sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and\nmorphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and\ntheir relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together\nwith confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density\nrelation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the\nlow-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming\nbulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at\nhigh masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison\nwith simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the\nfield significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The\nmorphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place\nbefore the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking\nplace within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming\nbulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching\nof star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in\nhigher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent\ndisc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones."}

Accepted for publication in ApJL. Comments are\n  welcome", "summary": "Bipolar sunspots, or more generally, Bipolar Magnetic Regions, BMRs, are the\ndynamic magnetic regions that appear on the solar surface and are central to\nsolar activity. One striking feature of these regions is that they are often\ntilted with respect to the equator, and this tilt increases with the latitude\nof appearance, popularly known as Joys law. Although this law has been examined\nfor over a century through various observations, its physical origin is still\nnot established. An attractive theory that has been put forward behind Joys law\nis the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube in the convection zone,\nwhich has been studied using the thin flux tube model. However, observational\nsupport for this theory is limited. If the Coriolis force is the cause of the\ntilt, then we expect BMRs to hold Joys law at their initial emergence on the\nsurface. By automatically identifying the BMRs over the last two solar cycles\nfrom high resolution magnetic observations, we robustly capture their initial\nemergence signatures on the surface. We find that from their appearance, BMRs\nexhibit tilts consistent with Joys law. This early tilt signature of BMRs\nsuggests that the tilt is developed underneath the photosphere, driven by the\nCoriolis force and helical convection, as predicted by the thin flux tube\nmodel. Considerable scatter around Joys law observed during the emergence\nphase, which reduces in the post emergence phase, reflects the interaction of\nthe vigorous turbulent convection with the rising flux tubes in the near\nsurface layer."}

To\nuncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study\nthe properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the\nIllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting\ncentral galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \\leq \\log(M_\\ast/{\\rm\nM_\\odot}) \\leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio\n($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host\ngalaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions\nfound in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\\lambda_{\\rm\nEdd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\\sim$ 1\\% ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\geq\n0.05$) to $\\sim$ 24\\% ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\geq 0.01$). In comparison with\nnon-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are\ndeficient in neutral gas, having $\\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in\nqualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger\nbeyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \\gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more\nextended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on\naverage, $\\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less\nstar-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN\ncan significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a\ndirect effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG.\nHowever, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the\ncomplete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an\norder of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed\ninvestigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and\nobservations."}

By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nstar-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference\nto reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant\nfor AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half\nof them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an\nisolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z <\n1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz > 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio\nluminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio\nappearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting\nstar-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated\nsystems. This is more significant as we move towards low\nradio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz < 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which\nwe find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold\nregardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need\nto accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio)\nactivity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots\nand lobes. This is mostly observed at z < 1, since in the local Universe\ngalaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts.\nInternal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation\nwithin the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with\nisolated systems at all redshifts probed.

In both stages and across all Mach\nnumbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian\nrandom field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more\ninterconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these\nmorphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work\nprovides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence\nand the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force\ntogether shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable\nframework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations."}

To complement this dataset,\nwe investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence\n(MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$\n(2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million\n(240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and\nphotometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which\ntakes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect\nstacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit\nmodified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean\ndust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find\nsimilar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the\naverage dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\\simeq$1 to the present\nday. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are\nwell-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\\rm e}^{-t/\\tau}$, where $t$ is\nthe age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\\pm0.1$K, and\n$\\tau=1.6\\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging\nto a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the\nexisting cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in\nstar-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust\ntemperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust\ntemperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the\ncontribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding\nthat it accounts for >60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\\mu$m. Forthcoming\nEuclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar\nmasses, and recover more of the CIB."}

While several 3D methods exist\nfor modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more\ncomputationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar\nrecoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the\nProjected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the\nBayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial\ncorrelations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms\nand assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both\nrecovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range\nfrom 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known\nground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly\nimproved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with\nPNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for\nSNR>40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by\nmodelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could\nsuccessfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local\nmetallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute\nmetallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with\nBayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we\nconclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and\ncharacterising stellar structures from IFS data."}

Our goal\nis to identify and investigate a population of sources characterised by highly\nionised emission lines in their spectra, which are indicative of active\ngalactic nucleus activity, extreme shock phenomena, or Wolf--Rayet stars. A\ncomprehensive visual inspection of spectra is conducted to ensure the\nreliability of the sample, focusing on the simultaneous detection of both NeV\nand OII emission-line measurements, a condition that restricts the Euclid\nspectroscopic redshift range to z=2.48--3.88. To characterise this population,\nwe analysed the morpho-spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies.\nThis allowed for a direct comparison with control sources that exhibit similar\nOII properties and spectroscopic redshifts, but not NeV lines. We identify\nsources solely based on spectroscopic criteria in the redshift range beyond the\nHalpha regime. Encompassing 65 potential NeV candidates, the resulting sample\ndelivers the first systematic probe of these NeV candidate emitters at high\nredshift. We found a good agreement, within 1$\\sigma$, between the spectral\nmeasurements calculated using both direct integration and Gaussian fitting\nmethodologies. The NeV candidates exhibit colours similar to bright QSOs, with\nonly a few in the tail of very red quasars. We observed a higher stellar mass\ncontent, a lower continuum around the 4000A break, and a similar S\\'{e}rsic\nindex distribution compared to the control sample. This unique sample paves the\nway for a wide range of scientific investigations, which will be pursued in the\nforthcoming data releases."}

We measure an\noccurrence rate of $0.28 \\pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting\npost-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar\nsub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \\pm 0.05$% for a sub-population\nrepresenting the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and\n$0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars.

While several 3D methods exist\nfor modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more\ncomputationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar\nrecoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the\nProjected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the\nBayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial\ncorrelations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms\nand assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both\nrecovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range\nfrom 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known\nground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly\nimproved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with\nPNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for\nSNR>40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by\nmodelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could\nsuccessfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local\nmetallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute\nmetallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with\nBayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we\nconclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and\ncharacterising stellar structures from IFS data."}

This is because the\nEarth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity\nhyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing.\nEarth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits\nclose to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of\ninclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at\nlow/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher\nimpact probability towards the ecliptic plane.
