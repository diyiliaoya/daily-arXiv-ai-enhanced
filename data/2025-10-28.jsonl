This distribution has been inferred from simulations of\nMilky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no\nsimulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This\nmotivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from\nobservations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the\nIllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the\ndark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find\nthat the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent\nnon-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed\ndistribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile,\nrecently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be\ntraced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar\npopulations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark\nmatter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good\nalignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these\ntwo contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter\nspeeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize\nstellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from\nthe Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar\nneighborhood."}

However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often\neject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical\ngrowth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in\ngiant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct\nsimulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally\nchallenging.

The work\ntraces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that\nproduced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the\nthermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet\nluminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different\nsupernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and\nredshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The\nsecond part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary\nstars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active\ngalactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen\nreionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer\nsimulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how\nthe timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and\nHe II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine\ntransition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the\npost-reionization IGM.

In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for\nthe first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104),\nCassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East\n(SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1\n(TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining\nGaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic\nmeasurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for\nsubstructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the\nsmallest populations in our sample contain $<20$ $M_{\\odot}$ of stellar mass,\nmaking them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial\nsubstructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\\odot}$\nassociation with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent\ncomplex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all\npopulations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from\n6.9 $\\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the\nfirst detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing\na largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important\nrole in tracing the processes that guide local star formation."}

Without the protection of an atmosphere, these planets\nare likely covered by a powder-like regolith, similar to the Moon. Laboratory\nstudies show that, under vacuum conditions, such regoliths can develop\nsubsurface temperature gradients, also known as the solid-state greenhouse\neffect. This effect can significantly modify the emission features of airless\nbodies, but its potential impact on exoplanets is still unexplored. Here we\nderive analytic solutions of the two-stream radiative transfer equations with\nscattering, absorption, plus emission, and combine them with Mie theory\ncalculations to model subsurface temperature gradients and emission spectra of\nairless exoplanets. The results show exo-regoliths can develop strong\nsolid-state greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects, with temperature gradients\n$>200$~K in the upper-most subsurface ($\\mathcal{O}(100)\\mu$m). These\ntemperature gradients alter surface emission features, modify secondary eclipse\ndepths by up to $\\sim50\\%$, and can produce higher-than-blackbody emission at\nsome wavelengths. In addition, we study whether subsurface temperature\ngradients can be disentangled from other microscopic effects, such as changes\nin space weathering or particle size. At least in some cases, the co-existence\nof these effects makes it essentially impossible to distinguish different\nsurface compositions within the precisions achievable by JWST. Overall,\nsubsurface temperature gradients thus open potentially new ways to characterize\nsurfaces of airless exoplanets, but they also complicate the interpretation of\nairless exoplanet spectra.

The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of\nsuch a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the\ninstrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum\nsignal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode\ngain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a\nthree-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data,\nseparating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to\nthe COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable\nresonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain\ndegeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of\nJupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show\nthat the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum\nsource, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two\napplications to COMAP.

For the Galactic COMAP observations,\nwhich map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain\nfluctuations while retaining all continuum signals.

Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes\nmagnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate\nspace-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D\nresistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations\ncontaining a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as\ninitial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find\nthat NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by\nreshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium\nin corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional\nsituation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament\ndecelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with\nobserved two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects\neruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as\na repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude\nincreases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic\nangles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and\nsimulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the\nNEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the\nacceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low\ncorona."}

The aim of this project is to\nassert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic\ndistance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least\nSquares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete\ntreatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to\ncompute new Period--Luminosity (PL) and Period--Wesenheit (PW) relations\ncalibrated using $\\sim$100 T2Cs, $\\sim$1000 fundamental-mode and $\\sim$750\nfirst-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC.

However, about 30% of\ndelta-ARs do not produce flares when their lifetimes are between 6-12 days. The\nlatitudinal distribution of delta-ARs across the northern and southern\nhemispheres is nearly symmetric on either side of the equator for SCs 23 and\n24, peaking around +/-10 deg-20 deg.

We\npresent a new SaXS implementation that converts solar emission measure\ndistributions (EMDs) of distinct coronal region types into XSPEC spectral\ncomponents and test whether broad-band X-ray spectra alone can recover their\nfilling factors. Methods. We built XSPEC multi-temperature spectral models for\nfour solar region types (background/quiet corona, active regions, cores, and\nflares) by using EMDs derived from Yohkoh/SXT data and translating each EMD bin\ninto an isothermal apec component. These models were fit (using PyXspec) to two\none-hour DAXSS spectra representative of quiescent (2022-06-29) and flaring\n(2022-04-25) states.

Using the Yohkoh/SXT EMDs, the quiescent Sun\nspectrum is dominated by active region emission (filling factor ~22%), with the\nbackground corona poorly constrained. The flaring Sun spectrum is best\ndescribed by a combination of active regions, cores, and flares with filling\nfactors of ~47.5%, ~4.1%, and ~0.062%, respectively.

The medium and\nlow velocity components are launched from the inner disk (< 6.76 stellar radii)\nwith low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines.\nHowever, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low\nvelocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the\nmedium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius.

However,\nlarge homogeneous catalogues of rotational velocities derived from\nhigh-resolution stellar spectra are still lacking. The main objective of this\nwork is to determine the line-broadening parameter (Vbroad), a proxy for the\nstellar rotational velocity, in a large sample of FGKM stars based on their\nESO/FEROS spectra, previously parameterised by the AMBRE Project. Vbroad was\nestimated by cross-correlating the FEROS spectra with AMBRE binary masks. This\nmethodology also relies on a specific calibration of a coupling constant\nbetween the rotational velocity and the width of the cross-correlation\nfunction. This fundamental step was performed by adopting the AMBRE grid of\nsynthetic spectra. The derived Vbroad were then validated using data from the\nliterature, ground-based spectroscopic surveys, and Gaia/RVS. After analysing\nmore than 5,000 FEROS spectra (including repeated spectra for several stars),\nwe obtained the line-broadening coefficients for 2,584 stars covering the FGKM\nspectral types, any stellar gravity, and metallicities between the metal-poor\nup to sub-solar regimes. The mean Vbroad relative uncertainty of this sample\nwas found to be smaller than 8%. As expected, most stars were found to be slow\nrotators (below a few km/s), in particular, cool dwarfs and giants. However,\nseveral hot dwarfs and high-luminosity stars with high-Vbroad rates were\nidentified, most of them not previously classified as fast rotators and/or\naffected by large macro-turbulent effects. The measured rotational broadening\nvalues are of high-quality and verified on the basis of literature comparisons.\nWe publicly provide this catalogue of Vbroad parameters, including stellar\natmospheric and quality parameters, for the analysed AMBRE/FEROS sources."}

While the core accretion paradigm is\nwidely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and\nintermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains\ndebated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their\nexistence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on\nmetallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy\nfor the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar\nphotospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in\nmetal-rich environments.

The most\nmassive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in\nagreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass\ndistribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity.

In the absence of\nstellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,\nproducing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,\nfragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding\nthe IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the\nISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both\nradiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:\nit survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being\nreplenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes\nplace. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling\nthe combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH\ngrowth.

We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two\nsubgroups within the Leaf.

Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the\ncolor-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to\ndate. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent\nmembers, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced\nquiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The\nstellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact\nat higher masses than their field counterparts.

The phase-space analysis\nindicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core.

Each 3.6$\\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual\nexposures with a pixel scale of 3.6\", a typical PSF of 6\", and a stack point\nsource depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1)\nincludes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean\nfields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of\nthe Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the\nINT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\\alpha$ filament\nwidths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45\" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs\n(with a median match distance of ~0.5\"), combined with our distinctive\nnarrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\\alpha$ variable and excess\nsources.

The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify\nan ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the\nMF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source\nimplementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community."}

Our analysis evaluates three recent\nfoundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal\nvideo representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting -\napplied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI\nmission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are\ntrained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria,\nwith the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer\nbackbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We\ninvestigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and\nscore-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance\ntypical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE\nachieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic\nTSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting\nskill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These\nfindings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and\ncross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting,\npaving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and\ntemporal information."}

Radio data probes both\nthermal and non-thermal emission, thereby constraining the relativistic\nelectron population. We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR\ncatalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope,\naiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength\nemission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars\nwith respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio\nemission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements,\nand compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength\nemission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six\nwere clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly\ndetected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at\n4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for\nmost sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and\nall Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal\nemission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked\nlayer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta\nOph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations. Our survey\nmarks a significant addition to the ca. 10 previously known radio-emitting bow\nshocks in the literature, and demonstrates that deep, targeted radio surveys\ncan effectively detect IR-selected bow shocks. Follow-up observations of these\ntargets at lower and higher frequencies are encouraged to determine whether any\nare non-thermal emitters like the bow shocks of BD+43, BD+60 and LS2355.\n(abridged)"}
