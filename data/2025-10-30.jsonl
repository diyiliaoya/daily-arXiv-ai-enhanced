The depth of the observational data used here\nenables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~\n10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for\nthe galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS.

However, the probability that a rocky planet\nmay exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple\nfactors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior\ncomposition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior\ncomposition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be\nimpacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first\nexploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet\nradius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky\nplanets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and\nGALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content)\nsignificantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for\nsurface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1\nM$_\\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may\nreduce the amount of surface water.

Here, we present results from a study to identify and\ncharacterize long-lived active regions (LLARs), defined as those which were\nobserved during at least two consecutive Carrington rotations and which did not\nundergo significant successive flux emergence once the decay phase began. Such\nactive regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and\n2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number. This\nimplies that LLARs are produced by the same basic driving processes as regular\nARs. LLAR areas tend to be significantly larger and contain more magnetic flux\ncompared to other ARs, but the two categories have similar magnetic complexity\ndistributions. The most striking result, however, is that LLARs are 3-6 times\nmore likely than other ARs to be the source of a solar flare of GOES class C or\ngreater.

The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales.

We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the\nquality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of\nsmall-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and\ncharacterization of the gravitational wave background.

To fully understand what determines the properties of observed\ncavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative\nprocesses in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary\ndiscs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size\nscales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models.

This is an instability of laminar flows\n(``Poincar\\'{e} flows\") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate,\nspin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in\nconvective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincar\\'{e} number\"\n$\\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the\nprecessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using\nCartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study\nits interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection.

We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to\nprovide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit\nof the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses\nand an orbital period of 1-6 days.

We\nattempt to measure the orbital decay rate $\\dot{P}$ caused by GW emission of\nZTFJ2130 and predict the expected GW signal for LISA. High-speed photometry was\nconducted using the FLI Kepler KL4040FI CMOS camera, mounted to the 1.2-meter\nOskar L\\\"uhning telescope at the Hamburg Observatory as well as the Hamamatsu\nORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera at the 1.23-meter telescope at CAHA in Spain.\nZTFJ2130 was observed on six nights between August 2024 and September 2025. The\nobtained lightcurves combined with previous high-cadence observations were used\nto conduct an O-C timing analysis. Additionally, we employed the LISA data\nanalysis tool ldasoft to model the expected GW data. We measure a period change\nof $(-1.97\\pm0.05)\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{ss^{-1}}$. Assuming only GW emission,\nthis result was used to calculate a chirp mass of\n$(0.408\\pm0.006)\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. From ldasoft we predict that LISA will\nbe able to measure the chirp mass with an uncertainty of 5%. We measure\n$\\dot{P}$ with an uncertainty of only 2% and show that modern (q)CMOS detectors\nare well suited to provide precise timing measurements, enabling the\nmeasurement of the orbital decay of UCBs with high precision with modest size\ntelescopes. The derived orbital decay is fully consistent with predictions from\nspectral and lightcurve modeling. We show that future observations with LISA\ncan potentially provide a deviation from only gravitational wave effects, e.g.\ndue to accretion, if the effect is sufficiently large."}

However, the probability that a rocky planet\nmay exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple\nfactors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior\ncomposition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior\ncomposition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be\nimpacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first\nexploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet\nradius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky\nplanets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and\nGALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content)\nsignificantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for\nsurface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1\nM$_\\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may\nreduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on\nseafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be\nflooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like\ntopographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form\nhigh-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering.

This is an instability of laminar flows\n(``Poincar\\'{e} flows\") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate,\nspin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in\nconvective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincar\\'{e} number\"\n$\\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large.
