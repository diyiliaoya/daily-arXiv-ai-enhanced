This bias makes it difficult to infer the true circumbinary planet population, highlighting the need for alternative detection methods that do not rely on transits. In this work, we explore one such approach by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyse TESS photometry of a sample of 1,590 eclipsing binaries from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue of Eclipsing Binary Candidates to identify systems exhibiting detectable apsidal precession. We rule general relativistic, tidal, and rotational contributions as insufficient to account for the measured apsidal precession, demonstrating that an additional gravitational perturber is required. This enables us to constrain the possible masses and orbital separations of a companion that would cause the observed precession. We present a new set of 27 candidate circumbinary planets identified through this precession-based method as well as 6 candidate companions with a higher minimum mass. Their inferred properties remain degenerate, as the same dynamical signatures can arise from lower-mass planets at less than 1 AU or from more massive companions on wider, few-AU orbits, reflecting the current uncertainty in characterising these systems. Radial velocities can help break this degeneracy and provide direct confirmation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67901590\u4e2a\u98df\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684TESS\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62f1\u7ebf\u8fdb\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8627\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\u548c6\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u4f34\u661f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u51cc\u661f\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u975e\u5171\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u51cc\u661f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u62f1\u7ebf\u8fdb\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5206\u6790Gaia DR3\u98df\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u661f\u8868\u4e2d\u76841590\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684TESS\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u62f1\u7ebf\u8fdb\u52a8\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8627\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\u548c6\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5b58\u5728\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\uff1a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u5c0f\u4e8e1AU\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u51e0AU\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u4f34\u661f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62f1\u7ebf\u8fdb\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u6253\u7834\u8d28\u91cf-\u8f68\u9053\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u786e\u8ba4\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002"}}

Pebble drift, coupled with volatile evaporation, has been proposed as a possible remedy to this with the level of heavy element enrichment a planet can accrete, as well as its atmospheric composition, being strongly dependent on where in the disc it is forming. We use a planet formation model which simulates the evolution of the protoplanetary disc, accounting for pebble growth, drift and evaporation, and the formation of planets from pebble and gas accretion. The growth and migration of planetary embryos is simulated in 10 different protoplanetary discs which have their chemical compositions matched to the host stars of the planets which we aim to reproduce, providing a more realistic model of their growth than previous studies. The heavy element content of giant exoplanets is used to infer their formation location and thus make a prediction of their atmospheric abundances. We focus here on giants more massive than Saturn, as we expect that their heavy element content is dominated by their envelope rather than their core. The heavy element content of 9 out of the 10 planets simulated is successfully matched to their observed values. Our simulations predict formation in the inner disc regions, where the majority of the volatiles have already evaporated and can thus be accreted onto the planet via the gas. As the majority of the planetary heavy element content originates from water vapour accretion, our simulations predict a high atmospheric O/H ratio in combination with a low atmospheric C/O ratio, in general agreement with observations. For certain planets, namely WASP-84b, these properties may be observable in the near future, offering a method of testing the constraints made on the planet's formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\u542b\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u5185\u76d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5438\u79ef\u83b7\u5f97\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u9ad8O/H\u6bd4\u548c\u4f4eC/O\u6bd4\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\u542b\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u5438\u79ef\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bcc\u96c6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u5176\u5927\u6c14\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5375\u77f3\u751f\u957f\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u84b8\u53d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u661f\u4ece\u5375\u77f3\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u572810\u4e2a\u4e0e\u539f\u4e3b\u661f\u5316\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u5339\u914d\u7684\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u661f\u80da\u80ce\u7684\u751f\u957f\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5339\u914d\u4e8610\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u4e2d9\u4e2a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\u542b\u91cf\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u5185\u76d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5438\u79ef\u83b7\u5f97\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5927\u6c14O/H\u6bd4\u548c\u4f4eC/O\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5375\u77f3\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u84b8\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51b3\u5b9a\u5176\u5927\u6c14\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6c14\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in the Earth, Planets and Space", "summary": "Icy planetesimals are likely to supply volatiles to terrestrial planets and serve as building blocks of icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Samples from the C-type asteroid Ryugu, collected by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, indicate a low-temperature history with aqueous alteration and organic materials. In contrast, iron meteorites with isotopic ratios similar to carbonaceous chondrites suggest exposure to higher temperatures. These findings imply that the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals is highly diverse. Since direct exploration provides only localized data, understanding this diversity requires comparing observational results with model calculations incorporating key evolutionary processes. We develop a model including radial growth, impact heating, water phase changes, aqueous alteration, and structural differentiation, to re-evaluate the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals during the first 100 Myr after CAI formation. The model considers final radius (10-1000 km), growth onset (1.0 or 2.0 Myr after CAI), growth duration (0.4 or 4.0 Myr), and growth mode (linear or runaway). Our results show that larger planetesimals generally reach higher temperatures, but growth timing and mode significantly affect thermal evolution. Early accretion leads to higher temperatures, with some bodies reaching the Fe-FeS eutectic (1250 K), while delayed or prolonged growth reduces heating. Our results show that the constituent materials of Ryugu, which kept below 40 degC, likely formed near the surface of a hydrated mineral layer. This is possible even in planetesimals several hundred kilometers in size due to efficient heat transport via convection. If accretion begins 2.0 Myr after CAI and completes in 0.4 Myr, a wide region in such a body could yield Ryugu's material.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51b0\u8d28\u661f\u5b50\u5728CAI\u5f62\u6210\u540e1\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u7684\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u661f\u5b50\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u751f\u957f\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u70ed\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Ryugu\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u6e29\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u94c1\u9668\u77f3\u9ad8\u6e29\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b0\u8d28\u661f\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u5730\u884c\u661f\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u5916\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u51b0\u8d28\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u5176\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002Ryugu\u6837\u672c\u663e\u793a\u4f4e\u6e29\u6c34\u8680\u53d8\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u7ec4\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u94c1\u9668\u77f3\u5374\u7ecf\u5386\u9ad8\u6e29\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5f84\u5411\u751f\u957f\u3001\u649e\u51fb\u52a0\u70ed\u3001\u6c34\u76f8\u53d8\u3001\u6c34\u8680\u53d8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5f02\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfCAI\u5f62\u6210\u540e1\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u51b0\u8d28\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u534a\u5f84(10-1000 km)\u3001\u751f\u957f\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4(CAI\u540e1.0\u62162.0 Myr)\u3001\u751f\u957f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4(0.4\u62164.0 Myr)\u548c\u751f\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f(\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u5931\u63a7)\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8f83\u5927\u661f\u5b50\u901a\u5e38\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u957f\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u5438\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u661f\u5b50\u53ef\u8fbeFe-FeS\u5171\u6676\u6e29\u5ea6(1250 K)\uff0c\u800c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u5ef6\u957f\u751f\u957f\u5219\u51cf\u5c11\u52a0\u70ed\u3002Ryugu\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u6750\u6599(\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u4e8e40\u00b0C)\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u6c34\u5408\u77ff\u7269\u5c42\u8fd1\u8868\u9762\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6570\u767e\u516c\u91cc\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u661f\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6d41\u70ed\u4f20\u8f93\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51b0\u8d28\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u957f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u3002Ryugu\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81eaCAI\u5f62\u6210\u540e2.0 Myr\u5f00\u59cb\u5438\u79ef\u30010.4 Myr\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u751f\u957f\u7684\u8f83\u5927\u661f\u5b50\u8868\u9762\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u65e9\u671f\u5929\u4f53\u70ed\u5386\u53f2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We quantified the accuracy with which the mass-to-flux ratio is recovered under various projection angles and dynamical stages by analyzing the magnetic field - gas column density relation, and comparing the \"observed\" mass-to-flux ratio against the true values. We find that projection effects have a major effect on measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio. Zeeman measurements can overestimate the true mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud by more than an order of magnitude when the magnetic field primarily lies on the plane of the sky. Therefore, measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio based on Zeeman observations should be considered as upper limits. Mass-to-flux ratio estimates inferred from polarization observations do not provide a physically meaningful probe of the true mass-to-flux ratio and can lead to unphysical results as they fail to capture the underlying correlation between the magnetic field and column density.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc73D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6295\u5f71\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4Zeeman\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4e91\u56e2\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6295\u5f71\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6e4d\u6d41\u574d\u7f29\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u78c1\u573a-\u6c14\u4f53\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u5f71\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0b\"\u89c2\u6d4b\"\u5230\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u5f71\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f53\u78c1\u573a\u4e3b\u8981\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5929\u7a7a\u5e73\u9762\u65f6\uff0cZeeman\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u65e0\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eZeeman\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0a\u9650\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8d28\u91cf-\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6295\u5f71\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We explore the possibility that this dynamical instability was triggered by the close passage of a star or substellar object during the Sun's embedded cluster phase. We run N-body simulations starting with the giant planets in a resonant chain and an outer planetesimal disk, with a wide-enough planet-disk separation to preserve the planets' orbital stability for $>$100 Myr. We subject the system to a single flyby, testing a wide range in flyby mass, velocity and closest approach distance. We find a variety of outcomes, from flybys that over-excite the system (or strip the planets entirely) to flybys too weak to perturb the planets at all. An intermediate range of flybys triggers a dynamical instability that matches the present-day Solar System. Successful simulations -- that match the giant planets' orbits without over-exciting the cold classical Kuiper belt -- are characterized by the flyby of a substellar object ($3-30 M_{Jup}$) passing within 20 au of the Sun. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Sun's birth cluster phase, parameterized by the product of the stellar density $\u03b7$ and the cluster lifetime $T$. The balance between under- and over-excitation of the young Solar System is at $\u03b7T \\approx 5 \\times 10^4$~Myr pc$^{-3}$, in a range consistent with previous work. We find a probability of $\\sim$1% that the Solar System's dynamical instability was triggered by a substellar flyby.

Accepted as a Letter in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "A subset of very young, super-early galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, often termed Blue Monsters, shows extremely blue UV continua and faint far-IR emission, which could imply much less dust than expected from standard enrichment scenarios. We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08z\u227310\uff09\u8d85\u65e9\u671f\u661f\u7cfb\"\u84dd\u8272\u602a\u7269\"\u4e2d\u5c18\u57c3\u542b\u91cf\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u661f\u56e2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u55b7\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6781\u7aef\u7834\u574f\u6216\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\"\u84dd\u8272\u602a\u7269\"\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5c18\u57c3\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e74\u8f7b\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u6781\u84dd\u7684UV\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u5fae\u5f31\u7684\u8fdc\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5c18\u57c3\u542b\u91cf\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bcc\u96c6\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u9884\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c18\u57c3\u5b58\u6d3b\u4ea7\u989d\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u8584\u58f3\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u56e2\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u4e91\u4e2d\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u55b7\u53d1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u55b7\u53d1\u534a\u5f84\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c14\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u6c14\u4f53-\u5c18\u57c3\u5728\u55b7\u53d1\u8fb9\u754c\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u661f\u56e2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u6574\u4f53\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u68b0\u55b7\u53d1\u80fd\u53bb\u9664\u5927\u91cf\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5c18\u57c3-\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u51c0\u5c18\u57c3\u4ea7\u989d\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6c14\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u4f4eZ\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002\u661f\u7cfb\u6574\u4f53\u503c\u843d\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u84dd\u8272\u602a\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u661f\u56e2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u55b7\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u84dd\u8272\u602a\u7269\u4e2d\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6781\u7aef\u539f\u4f4d\u7834\u574f\u6216\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u5c18\u57c3\u542b\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

On November 11, 2025, the Aragats Solar Neutron Telescope (ASNT) recorded a statistically significant increase in high-energy neutron and muon fluxes associated with an X5.1 flare and the subsequent Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) event. The event displayed a unique dual-peak profile: an initial hard component at 10 28 UT, followed by a softer yet still energetic peak at 10 45 UT. For the first time, we report simultaneous energy spectra of atmospheric neutrons and muons measured in the 10 600 MeV range at Aragats. Broken-power-law fits reveal a clear temporal evolution of acceleration conditions, evidenced by spectral indices declining with energy.

As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\\circ$C for a 10 cm $\\times$ 10 cm $\\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users.

We have collected all the NEOWISE observations of 2001 CC21 from Nov 2021 through Feb 2024, a total of 132 frames, and analyzed this data to estimate an infrared radiometric diameter. We analyze the multi-epoch 3.4 and 4.6 micron NEOWISE data using an ellipsoidal rotating, cratered ThermoPhysical Model (TPM) to obtain estimates for the diameter, rotation pole, shape, and thermal inertia. 2001 CC21 is quite faint at 4.6 microns when Delta is about 0.7 AU, so the resulting diameter is substantially smaller than the 700 meters derived from the H magnitude and L spectral type. Recent polarimetric data has also suggested a smaller diameter, but not quite as small as the diameter derived from the thermal IR data. A fit to an ellipsoidal TPM model gives a volume equivalent sphere diameter of 337-27+33 meters [posterior median and central 68% confidence interval].

Here we solve for the full orbital architecture of the bright intermediate-mass nearby system Lambda Ophiuchi based on astrometric measurements of the outer orbit (period of 129 years) compiled in the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars and new VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric measurements that are used to determine the inner orbit (period of 42 days). The orbits are retrograde and misaligned by either $88.5\\pm1.9^o$ or $113.5\\pm1.9^o$, which in either case results in the inner binary currently undergoing ZKL oscillations. While pure Newtonian point source evolution would have predicted the stars in the inner binary to have merged long ago, in reality the eccentricity oscillations are significantly modulated by general relativistic, tidal and rotational bulge precession. We show that due to the effect of ``slaved'' precession the dynamics can still be solved semi-analytically. We find that the (currently unknown) inclination angles between the stellar spins axes and the inner orbital axis play a very important role in the amplitude of the ZKL oscillations, which is at a minimum $\u0394e = e_{\\mathrm{max}} - e_{\\mathrm{min}} \\simeq 0.15$ and could be as high as $\u0394e \\simeq 0.70$. We argue that currently feasible spectroscopic and interferometric observations could allow for a complete and unique dynamical solution for this system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u6790\u4e86Lambda Ophiuchi\u4e09\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6b63\u5728\u7ecf\u5386von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u81ea\u8f6c\u9686\u8d77\u8fdb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5185\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u540c\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5bfc\u81f4von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov\u632f\u8361\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u6790Lambda Ophiuchi\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7b2c\u516d\u7248\u76ee\u89c6\u53cc\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u7f16\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5468\u671f129\u5e74\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u7684VLTI/GRAVITY\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u8f68\u9053\uff08\u5468\u671f42\u5929\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u5305\u542b\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u81ea\u8f6c\u9686\u8d77\u8fdb\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Lambda Ophiuchi\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u4e3a\u9006\u884c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u5939\u89d288.5\u00b11.9\u00b0\u6216113.5\u00b11.9\u00b0\uff09\uff0c\u5185\u53cc\u661f\u6b63\u5728\u7ecf\u5386ZKL\u632f\u8361\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7eaf\u725b\u987f\u70b9\u6e90\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u53cc\u661f\u65e9\u5df2\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u632f\u8361\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u81ea\u8f6c\u9686\u8d77\u8fdb\u52a8\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u5236\u3002ZKL\u632f\u8361\u5e45\u5ea6\u5728\u0394e=0.15\u52300.70\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u8f74\u4e0e\u5185\u8f68\u9053\u8f74\u7684\u5939\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u6790\u4e86Lambda Ophiuchi\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\"\u4ece\u52a8\"\u8fdb\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ecd\u53ef\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u6052\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u8f74\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u8f74\u7684\u5939\u89d2\u5bf9ZKL\u632f\u8361\u5e45\u5ea6\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5e72\u6d89\u89c2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u4e3a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u3002"}}

Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. We have developed atmospheric and evolutionary models for this emerging population. We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$9 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$10 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $>3\u03c3$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u6052\u661f\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u51cc\u661f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6838\u71c3\u70e7\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6c18\u71c3\u70e7\u548c\u6c22\u71c3\u70e7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6bd4\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6216\u4e91\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cc\u661f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5b64\u7acb\u573a\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51cc\u661f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u662f\u68c0\u9a8c\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u548c\u5de8\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u6838\u71c3\u70e7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e8646\u4e2a\u51cc\u661f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u70c8\u6052\u661f\u8f90\u5c04\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5927\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5165\u5c04\u901a\u91cflog10(F/cgs)\u22659\u65f6\u3002\u8f90\u5c04\u4f7f\u6c18\u71c3\u70e7\u548c\u6c22\u71c3\u70e7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e16%\u548c13%\u3002\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5ffd\u7565\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u62df\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u8f90\u5c04\u5929\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6052\u661f\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u884c\u661f-\u8910\u77ee\u661f-\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6216\u4e91\u5c42\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u670910\u4e2a\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b58\u5728>3\u03c3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f90\u5c04\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 40 barium dwarfs -- 36 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\\rm C_2$ absorption bands, linking them to CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries as a powerful laboratory for constraining binary mass-transfer physics and the origins of chemically peculiar stars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u76d6\u4e9aDR3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86160\u4e2a\u767d\u77ee\u661f+\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8640\u4e2a\u94a1\u77ee\u661f\uff08\u5176\u4e2d36\u4e2a\u4e3a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AGB\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9s-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u77ee\u661f+\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fs-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3AGB\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f34\u661f\u5316\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6b8a\u6052\u661f\u8d77\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76d6\u4e9aDR3\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790160\u4e2aAU\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f+\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8s-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eAGB\u6838\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8640\u4e2a\u94a1\u77ee\u661f\uff0836\u4e2a\u4e3a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u94a1\u77ee\u661f\u6570\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\uff1bs-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e30\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u661f\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u6700\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u94a1\u77ee\u661f\u663e\u793a\u5f3aCH\u548cC\u2082\u5438\u6536\u5e26\u3002", "conclusion": "s-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u7531\u4f9b\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548cAGB\u661f\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u70ed\u8109\u51b2\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u76d6\u4e9a\u767d\u77ee\u661f+\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6b8a\u6052\u661f\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002"}}

This is the first paper of a series, accompanying arXiv:2511.11805", "summary": "We analyze stellar population properties of 552 galaxies at redshift 0.6<z<0.77 from the LEGA-C spectroscopic survey. This first paper in a series presents the catalog of revised absorption indices for LEGA-C DR3 and inferred physical parameters, and derives benchmark scaling relations for the general massive galaxy population at intermediate redshift. We estimate light-weighted mean ages and stellar metallicities by interpreting key stellar absorption features and rizYJ photometry in a Bayesian framework with a comprehensive library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuations. We discuss systematic uncertainties within our method and compared to other spectral fitting approaches. We derive volume-weighted scaling relations of light-weighted mean ages and stellar metallicities with stellar mass for the general galaxy population at <z>=0.7 and masses >10^10Msun. The downsizing trends observed locally were already in place 6 Gyr ago. We observe bimodal age distribution as a function of mass, transitioning around 10^11Msun. No bimodality appears in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, which changes from steep to flat across 10^10.8Msun. Similar trends emerge for age and metallicity with velocity dispersion, but with sharper transition from young to old around log(sigma)=2.3. Differences with respect to trens with stellar mass suggest that age primarily depends on velocity dispersion below and above the transition regime, while both stellar mass and velocity dispersion contribute to stellar metallicity. The catalogs of revised absorption index measurements for LEGA-C DR3 and inferred stellar population physical parameters will be released to public repositories.

One consequence of this proximity is the expectation of spin synchronization, with implications for atmospheric circulation. Several mechanisms can maintain non-zero obliquities over long timescales in compact multi-planet systems, including capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) and other forms of secular spin-orbit coupling; such pathways are plausible in the orbital architectures of close-in M-dwarf planets. In this study, we search for transit duration variations (TDVs) consistent with the nodal precession rates predicted by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory in compact M-dwarf multi-planet systems. Our sample includes 23 exoplanets orbiting 12 stars. We compare recent, high-precision transit durations obtained from JWST white-light curves with measurements published at the discovery epoch and afterward. The resulting transit duration variation ranges from seconds to minutes, and we fit a linear trend to duration versus time for each planet. All systems are consistent with flat (no TDV) at the 3\u03c3 level. The strongest candidate is TRAPPIST-1d, whose fitted slope differs from zero with 2.2\u03c3 confidence. We calculate the expected TDV signals predicted by secular precession and compare them to the observed limits. Our null detection is consistent with the low-impact-parameter regime, where theoretical TDVs are only a few seconds per decade and below our sensitivity.

Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z>1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z>1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics. The chemical signatures of N/O-enhanced galaxies in our sample resembles that of first-generation globular cluster stars, suggesting that the moderate nitrogen enhancement may reflect the late stages of a cluster-driven enrichment mode that dominated at earlier cosmic epochs. However, the relevance and relative contribution of different mechanisms (e.g. burstiness of the star-formation history, contribution from older stellar populations, differential metal-loaded outflows, inflows of pristine gas) remains to be fully disentangled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRSpec\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u7ea2\u79fbz~1-6\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6c2e\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6c2e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u672c\u5730\u661f\u7cfb\u9ad8\u7ea60.18 dex\uff0c\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u66f4\u5927\u8fbe0.3-0.4 dex\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6c2e\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5316\u5b66\u5bcc\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6c2e\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JWST/NIRSpec\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea2\u79fbz>1\u768476\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6c2e\u548c\u6c27\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5f3a\u7ebf\u8bca\u65ad\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790430\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6c2e\u6c27\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u7ea60.18 dex\uff0c\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u66f4\u5927\u8fbe0.3-0.4 dex\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5f3a\u7ebfN/O\u8bca\u65ad\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0N2O2\u548cN2S2\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u661f\u7cfb\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6c2e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ee3\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u661f\u56e2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bcc\u96c6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u6027\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5916\u6d41\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u6c14\u4f53\u6d41\u5165\u7b49\uff09\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

A persistent property of the cycle is its asymmetry: the rise phase is usually much shorter than the decay phase. This asymmetry is often linked to variations in the Sun's meridional circulation, but it is unclear whether these variations are mainly deterministic, produced by Lorentz-force feedback, or stochastic in nature. We investigate this question using kinematic flux-transport dynamo simulations that include three types of time-dependent meridional flow: deterministic variations, stochastic fluctuations, and hybrid combinations of both. We evaluate cycle asymmetry using the ratio of rise to decay times and correlations of cycle amplitude with rise time, rise rate, and decay rate. Our results show that the temporal evolution of the meridional flow strongly controls cycle asymmetry. When both the meridional circulation and the Babcock-Leighton mechanism vary stochastically, the model does not produce cycles in which the decay phase is consistently longer than the rise phase. In contrast, deterministic variations motivated by Lorentz-force feedback and linked to the latitude of maximum toroidal field reproduce the observed asymmetry. In these cases, the meridional flow weakens near cycle maximum, stays reduced for some time, and then recovers, producing a longer decay phase. Hybrid models that mix deterministic and stochastic variability also match the observed rise-decay asymmetry. Across all simulations, cycle amplitude correlates strongly with rise rate, while correlations with rise time and decay rate are weaker but remain significant. These results highlight the key role of meridional flow variability in shaping solar cycle asymmetry and show that incorporating such variability can improve forecasting tools such as Solar Predict.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u901a\u8f93\u8fd0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u5468\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u4e0a\u5347\u76f8\u77ed\u4e8e\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u963311\u5e74\u6d3b\u52a8\u5468\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6d3b\u52a8\u5468\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u7279\u6027\u662f\u5176\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u4e0a\u5347\u76f8\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u77ed\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e38\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\uff08\u7531\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u4ea7\u751f\uff09\u8fd8\u662f\u968f\u673a\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u78c1\u901a\u8f93\u8fd0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u5347\u4e0e\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u3001\u5468\u671f\u632f\u5e45\u4e0e\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u4e0a\u5347\u901f\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u901f\u7387\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a7\u5236\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u548cBabcock-Leighton\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u6301\u7eed\u957f\u4e8e\u4e0a\u5347\u76f8\u7684\u5468\u671f\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u7531\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u73af\u5411\u573a\u7eac\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6781\u5927\u9644\u8fd1\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u51cf\u5f31\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u5347-\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u632f\u5e45\u4e0e\u4e0a\u5347\u901f\u7387\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u4e0e\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u901f\u7387\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u4f46\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u5348\u73af\u6d41\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u5851\u9020\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u5468\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbSolar Predict\u7b49\u9884\u62a5\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u75283.6\u7c73DOT\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6563\u6591\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u6697\u5f31\u4f34\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u9762\u5149\u5b66\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u53d7\u884d\u5c04\u6781\u9650\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u89c2\u6d4b\u672a\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u70b9\u6e90\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u8868\u9762\u548c\u89d2\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8865\u5145\u83b7\u53d6\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283.6\u7c73DOT\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u83b7\u53d6\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6563\u6591\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6697\u5f31\u4f34\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6563\u6591\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6563\u6591\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89d2\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6697\u5f31\u4f34\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u5c3a\u5bf84\u7c73\u7ea7\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08\u5982DOT\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6052\u661f\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6563\u6591\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u5370\u5ea6\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5149\u5b66\u5e72\u6d89\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Methodology validation with HST point-source images of Proxima Centauri", "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We present the first results of the Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES) project, aimed at validating and characterizing candidate exoplanets around the nearest systems using multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$\u03bc$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\\sim$1$\u03c3$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $\u03bc$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARES\u9879\u76ee\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u591a\u65f6\u671f\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u5019\u9009\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6bd4\u90bb\u661f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7ed3\u5408Gaia\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u884c\u661fProxima c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u5019\u9009\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6863\u6848\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u70b9\u6e90\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Gaia DR3\u661f\u8868\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u957f\u671fHST\u548c\u77ed\u671fGaia\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6bd4\u90bb\u661f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u81ea\u884c\u548c\u89c6\u5dee\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a~0.4\u6beb\u89d2\u79d2\u300150\u5fae\u89d2\u79d2/\u5e74\u548c0.2\u6beb\u89d2\u79d2\uff0c\u4e0eGaia\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5728~1\u03c3\u5185\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u5706\u5f62\u3001\u6b63\u9762\u8f68\u9053\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1Proxima c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4} M\u2295\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u4f46\u53d7\u5f53\u524d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86ARES\u9879\u76ee\u4e0b\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u5229\u7528HST\u7a7a\u95f4\u626b\u63cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u5341\u5fae\u89d2\u79d2\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u641c\u7d22\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy. These results demonstrate the power of implicit likelihood inference for optimizing stellar stream observational strategies and forecasting DM subhalo constraints from upcoming surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1(NPE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b50\u6655\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28(DM)\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b50\u6655\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4ece\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50\u6655\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1(NPE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e91\u5265\u79bb\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u7c92\u5b50\u55b7\u96fe\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ee5ATLAS-Aliqa Uma\u6d41\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2aNPE\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9884\u6d4bLSST\u30014MOST\u548c10\u5e74Gaia\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "NPE\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5b8c\u65746D\u5750\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u5bf910^7 M\u2299\u5b50\u6655\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523015-20%\uff1b5D\u5750\u6807\uff08\u6392\u9664\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u4ece50%\uff08\u5f53\u524d\uff09\u523020-40%\uff08\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\uff09\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u53cc\u5cf0\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6052\u661f\u793a\u8e2a\u7269\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u6d4b\u5149\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u540e\u7eed\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b50\u6655\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Radio Emission from Intermediate-Mass Protostars", "comment": "Submitted to ApJ, comments welcome", "summary": "We present results from Very Large Array (VLA) radio continuum observations of twelve intermediate-mass (IM) protostars, as part of the \\textit{SOFIA} Massive Star Formation Survey. Using these observations, we studied their morphology, multiplicity and radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Across our target regions, we resolve multiple compact sources and report eight new detections, four of which are entirely new and four that have counterparts at other wavelengths, but are detected here for the first time at radio frequencies. Based on radio morphologies and spectral indices, we assess the nature of the detected sources, highlighting seven that display jet-like structures and spectral indices consistent with ionized jets. Combining our results with the SOMA Radio I and II results, we expand the overall sample to 29 protostars, covering a bolometric luminosity range from $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim 10^2$ to $10^6\\:L_\\odot$. These sources help define a potential evolutionary sequence in the radio versus bolometric luminosity diagram. IM protostars have radio luminosities that are lower than expected from a simple power law extrapolation from low-mass protostars. However, this result is consistent with theoretical expectations from protostellar evolution models, which show low levels of photoionization and reduced shock ionization emission due to expanded stellar radii during this phase. Overall our expanded SOMA Radio sample provides new constraints on theoretical models of massive protostellar evolution, especially the connection to ionized gas structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA\u89c2\u6d4b12\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b08\u4e2a\u65b0\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u524d\u6837\u672c\u517129\u4e2a\u539f\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c04\u7535\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u70ed\u5149\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u5c04\u7535\u5149\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u751a\u5927\u5929\u7ebf\u9635(VLA)\u5bf912\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u5c04\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSOMA Radio I\u548cII\u7684\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u621029\u4e2a\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b08\u4e2a\u65b0\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\uff084\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\uff0c4\u4e2a\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5c04\u7535\u6ce2\u6bb5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4e2a\u663e\u793a\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0e\u7535\u79bb\u55b7\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u3002\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u5149\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4ece\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7b80\u5355\u5e42\u5f8b\u5916\u63a8\u7684\u9884\u671f\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c04\u7535\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u70ed\u5149\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684SOMA Radio\u6837\u672c\u4e3a\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u9636\u6bb5\u7531\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6269\u5f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u5149\u81f4\u7535\u79bb\u6c34\u5e73\u4f4e\u548c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u7535\u79bb\u53d1\u5c04\u51cf\u5c11\u3002"}}

By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower.

Accepted for publication in Icarus", "summary": "During their formative stages, giant planets are fed by infalling material sourced from the background circumstellar disk. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the incoming gas and dust collects into a circumplanetary disk that processes the material before it reaches the central planet itself. This work investigates the complex vertical structure of these circumplanetary disks and calculates their radiative signatures. A self-consistent numerical model of the temperature and density structure of the circumplanetary environment reveals that circumplanetary disks are thick and hot, with aspect ratios $H/R\\sim0.1-0.25$ and temperatures approaching that of the central planet. The disk geometry has a significant impact on the radiative signatures, allowing future observations to determine critical system parameters. The resulting disks are gravitationally stable and viscosity is sufficient to drive the necessary disk accretion. However, sufficiently rapid mass accretion can trigger a thermal instability, which sets an upper limit on the mass accretion rate. This paper shows how the radiative signatures depend on the properties of the planetary system and discuss how the system parameters can be constrained by future observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5468\u56f4\u76d8\uff08circumplanetary disks\uff09\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76d8\u539a\u800c\u70ed\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u786e\u5b9a\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u80cc\u666f\u661f\u5468\u76d8\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5728\u884c\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76d8\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6d3d\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u76d8\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u76d8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u76d8\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7c98\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u76d8\u539a\u800c\u70ed\uff08H/R~0.1-0.25\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u884c\u661f\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u76d8\u5177\u6709\u5f15\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7c98\u6027\u8db3\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u5438\u79ef\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5feb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4f1a\u89e6\u53d1\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u76d8\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u89c2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

This study combines around two hundred hours of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations on ten $z > 8$ galaxies, revealing no significant dust emission down to a $1 \u03c3$ depth of $2.0$, $2.0$, and $1.5 \\,\u03bc$Jy at rest-frame 158, 88 $\u03bc$m, and across all the data, respectively. This constrains average dust masses to be below $< 10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ at $3 \u03c3$ and dust-to-stellar mass ratios to be below $3.7 \\times{} 10^{-4}$ (assuming $T_{\\rm dust} = 50$ K and $\u03b2_{\\rm dust} = 2.0$).

Submitted to AAS Journals - comments welcome!", "summary": "The unexpectedly large radii of transiting hot Jupiters have led to many proposals for the physical mechanisms responsible for heating their interiors. While it has been shown that hot Jupiters reinflate as their host stars brighten due to heating deep in planetary interiors, young hot Jupiters also exhibit signs of delayed cooling possibly related to heating closer to their surfaces. To investigate this tension, we enhance our previously published hot Jupiter thermal evolution model by adding a parameter that allows for both deep heating and delayed cooling. We fit our thermal evolution models to a homogeneous, physically self-consistent catalog of accurate and precise hot Jupiter system properties in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We find that hot Jupiters' interior cooling rates are reduced on average by 95\\%--98\\% compared to simpler anomalous heating models. The most plausible explanation for this inference is substantial shallow heating just below their radiative--convective boundaries that enables reinflation with much less deep heating. Shallow heating by Ohmic dissipation and/or temperature advection are therefore important components of accurate models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, especially in circulation models. If hot Jupiters are inflated primarily by shallow heating as we propose, then we predict that their observed phase curve offsets should increase with temperature in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim1500~\\text{K}$, peak in the range $1500~\\text{K}~\\lesssim~T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim~1800~\\text{K}$, and decrease in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\gtrsim~1800~\\text{K}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5f02\u5e38\u81a8\u80c0\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u53d1\u73b0\u6d45\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u6bd4\u6df1\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u901f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e95%-98%\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u5f02\u5e38\u81a8\u80c0\u73b0\u8c61\u9700\u8981\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u8c03\u6df1\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\uff0c\u4f46\u5e74\u8f7b\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u6d45\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b7\u5374\u8ff9\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5f20\u529b\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5148\u524d\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6df1\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u5230\u540c\u8d28\u3001\u7269\u7406\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\u76ee\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u51b7\u5374\u901f\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e95%-98%\u3002\u6700\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u8f90\u5c04-\u5bf9\u6d41\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u65b9\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6d45\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u81a8\u80c0\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u6b27\u59c6\u8017\u6563\u548c/\u6216\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u6d41\u662f\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5982\u679c\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6d45\u5c42\u52a0\u70ed\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u76f8\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u5728T_eq\u22721500K\u65f6\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u57281500K\u2272T_eq\u22721800K\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u5728T_eq\u22731800K\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u3002"}}

It was developed in detail from the 4-year-long Kepler light curves, which provided a practical means to measure the rotation frequency in the transition layer between the convective core and the radiative envelope, where the local buoyancy frequency reaches a maximum. Recently, a new buoyancy glitch inversion method based on the Fourier spectra of gravity-mode period spacings was developed to probe that region further (Guo 2025). We aim to exploit the information contained in the variability of gravity-mode period spacings ($\u0394P$) in Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars with rotation. We investigate how well the main-sequence evolutionary stage can be inferred from this variability. We extract the frequency and amplitude of the variability in $\u0394P$ from the Fourier spectrum (FT). Both the period spacing $\u0394P$ and its periodic perturbations $\u03b4P$ (deviations from their asymptotic values) are used. The measured dominant frequency of $\u0394P$ allows us to infer the central hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$, which is a main-sequence age indicator. The inferred $X_c$ values from $FT(\u0394P)$ mostly agree with previous results reported in the literature based on forward modelling of individual identified mode frequencies.\n  We find that the buoyancy glitches $\u03b4N/N$ in SPB stars are generally less than $2\\%$ in amplitude. Ensemble asteroseismic modeling of gravity-mode pulsators can now be carried out efficiently with our novel $FT(\u0394P)$ method once the internal rotation rate of the pulsators is known. Our methodology offers a fast method for gravito-inertial asteroseismic applications in the era of ongoing and future space-based observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5468\u671f\u95f4\u8ddd\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6d41\u6838\u4e0e\u8f90\u5c04\u5305\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6c22\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740CoRoT\u548cKepler\u7b49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u661f\u9707\u5b66\u5f97\u4ee5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6d41\u6838\u4e0e\u8f90\u5c04\u5305\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5468\u671f\u95f4\u8ddd(\u0394P)\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5468\u671f\u95f4\u8ddd\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6270\u52a8(\u03b4P)\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u4ece\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u0394P\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9891\u7387\u548c\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6c22\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570(Xc)\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0SPB\u661f\u4e2d\u7684\u6d6e\u529b\u7a81\u53d8(\u03b4N/N)\u632f\u5e45\u901a\u5e38\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7FT(\u0394P)\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u65ad\u7684Xc\u503c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7ed3\u679c\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8109\u52a8\u661f\u7684\u7cfb\u7efc\u661f\u9707\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cd\u529b-\u60ef\u6027\u661f\u9707\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $\u03c3_{xy}/\u03bb\\lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (> 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction. This conclusion holds for the 21-cm window with $k_\\parallel > 0.5$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ over the range of $k_\\perp = 0.003 - 0.009$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SPADE-21cm\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6708\u7403\u80cc\u9762DEX\u9635\u5217\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6697\u65f6\u4ee321\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bb9\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ed1\u6697\u65f6\u4ee3\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c21\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u8be5\u65f6\u671f\u7269\u8d28\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002DEX\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u6708\u7403\u80cc\u9762\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u51d1\u7f51\u683c\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u90e8\u7f72\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6708\u7403\u8868\u9762\u8d77\u4f0f\u800c\u504f\u79bb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u79fb\u5bf921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SPADE-21cm\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5929\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6708\u7403\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6697\u65f6\u4ee321\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6708\u7403\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a2a\u5411(xy)\u548c\u5782\u76f4(z)\u504f\u79fb\u57287-12 MHz\u548c30-35 MHz\u9891\u6bb5\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e8630-35 MHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5bb9\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u4f7f\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u9ed1\u6697\u65f6\u4ee321\u5398\u7c73\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4ea7\u751f10-30%\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u572832.5 MHz\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a2a\u5411\u504f\u79fb\u03c3_xy/\u03bb\u22720.027\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u6c61\u67d3(>50%\u4fe1\u53f7)\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4fdd\u6301\u57281%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff1b\u800c\u5782\u76f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u9002\u7528\u4e8ek_\u2225>0.5 h cMpc\u207b\u00b9\u4e14k_\u22a5=0.003-0.009 h cMpc\u207b\u00b9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u768421\u5398\u7c73\u7a97\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9DEX\u9635\u5217\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ed1\u6697\u65f6\u4ee321\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6a2a\u5411\u504f\u79fb\u5bb9\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u5df2\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002SPADE-21cm\u7ba1\u9053\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9635\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) represent the largest individual astrophysical structures, rivalling galaxy clusters in physical extent. Understanding how they attain such scales demands examining their large scale cosmic surroundings, particularly the under explored filament environment. We quantify the three dimensional (3D) distance of GRGs from the nearest filament spine; test how this distance correlates with their growth and formation of different morphological classes; assess whether their radio jets exhibit preferred orientations relative to filament axes; and examine how filament anisotropy from spine to periphery modulates radio morphology. We employed a filament catalogue from the SDSS together with the largest GRG catalogue currently available. For each source, we measured the comoving distance to the nearest filament spine, the projected jet spine orientation angle, and quantified lobe asymmetry via the arm length ratio (ALR). These metrics trace proximity, directionality, and the impact of filamentary environment on morphology. We then compared GRGs with a control sample of small radio galaxies (SRGs) to constrain the environmental factors that regulate the attainment of giant sizes. We validated the robustness of our results via bootstrap resampling and non parametric statistical tests. Our results show that GRGs and SRGs have similar filament occupancy. By contrast, GRGs preferentially display larger alignment angles relative to filament spines, while SRG orientations are consistent with a random distribution.

Attainment of giant sizes is not governed by proximity to filaments; rather, it correlates with jet filament alignment.

The exact mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not fully known although progress has been made with some systems. Here, we present a study of a disk outburst of the southern Be star \u03bb Pavonis (HD 173948). Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra taken contemporaneously with TESS photometry in 2023. During the final days of TESS monitoring, the star began building a disk from a pristine diskless state. We find that the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk is circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher energy He I first, then lower energy transitions, with the decay ending last for H\u03b1. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations in Balmer lines, He I lines, and the weak photospheric Si III 5739 line. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest spectral signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the weaker signals. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, causing their apparent incoherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5357\u5929Be\u661f\u03bb Pavonis\u7684\u76d8\u72b6\u7206\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7698\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u548cTESS\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76d8\u57285\u5929\u5185\u5f62\u6210\uff0c12\u5929\u5185\u73af\u5316\uff0c\u8870\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u9ad8\u80fdHe I\u7ebf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5230H\u03b1\u7ebf\u7ed3\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "Be\u661f\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684B\u578b\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u76d8\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6d88\u6563\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u03bb Pavonis\u7684\u76d8\u72b6\u7206\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3Be\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528698\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u4e0eTESS\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b66H I\u548cHe I\u8c31\u7ebf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u76d8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u73af\u5316\u548c\u8870\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7TESS\u6d4b\u5149\u548c\u8c31\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u8109\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u76d8\u57285\u5929\u5185\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66H I\u548cHe I\u7ebf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea612\u5929\u5185\u73af\u5316\uff1b\u8870\u53d8\u4ece\u9ad8\u80fdHe I\u7ebf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5230H\u03b1\u7ebf\u7ed3\u675f\uff1bTESS\u6d4b\u5149\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff081.644\u548c1.485 cycles/d\uff09\u5728\u7206\u53d1\u524d\u540e\u5747\u672a\u5728\u8c31\u7ebf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff1b\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f0.163 cycles/d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03bb Pavonis\u7684\u76d8\u72b6\u7206\u53d1\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76Be\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d8\u5feb\u901f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8870\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8109\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u6d4b\u5149\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of $R_{\\rm{eff}} \\sim 5$ pc, stellar masses of $M_{*} \\sim 10^{6}-10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$, and high stellar mass surface densities of $\u03a3_{*} > 10^{4}\\,M_{\\odot}~\\rm{pc}^{-2}$. While their stellar populations are very young ($\\sim 5-9$ Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency ($\u03be_{\\rm{ion}}$) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb6.2\u7684\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfbMACS0308-zD1\uff08\"\u5b87\u5b99\u4e4b\u77db\"\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u81f4\u5bc6\u661f\u56e2\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u56e2\u534a\u5f84\u4ec5\u7ea65pc\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe10^6-10^7\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc710^4\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf/\u5e73\u65b9pc\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u4ec55-9\u767e\u4e07\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e74\u9f84\u5927\u4e8e1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5f15\u529b\u675f\u7f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08z>6\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u81f4\u5bc6\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u56e2\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JWST\u7684NIRCam\u6210\u50cf\u548cNIRSpec IFU\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u7d2b\u5916\u5230\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u653e\u5927\u76ee\u6807\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\u81f4\u5bc6\u7684\u661f\u56e2\uff0c\u534a\u5f84\u7ea65pc\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf10^6-10^7\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6>10^4\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf/\u5e73\u65b9pc\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u4ec55-9\u767e\u4e07\u5e74\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u56e2\u5728\u5927\u5c0f-\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u56e2\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u6bd4\u5c40\u90e8\u661f\u56e2\u66f4\u81f4\u5bc6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u6700\u4eae\u56e2\u5757\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u7565\u6709\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u9053\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u83b1\u66fc\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u9003\u9038\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u81f4\u5bc6\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u675f\u7f1a\u661f\u56e2\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u56e2\u6bd4\u5c40\u90e8\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u661f\u56e2\u66f4\u81f4\u5bc6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u6291\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u6697\u793a\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we report on the extremely energetic EUV late phase of a pair of C-class flares (SOL2012-06-17T17:26:11) observed on 2012 June 17 in NOAA active region 11504 by the \\textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) instrument on board the \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). The light curves integrated over the flaring region show that a factor of 4.2 more energy is released in the ``warm'' (2$-$3$\\times 10^6$~K) temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 335 \u00c5) during the late phase than during the main peaks. The origin of the emission in this extremely energetic EUV late phase is a non-eruptive sigmoid situated in a multi-polar magnetic field configuration, which is rapidly energised by C-class flares. The sigmoid plasma appears to reach temperatures in excess of $10^7$~K, before cooling to produce the EUV late-phase emission. This is seen in high-temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 131 \u00c5) and by using differential emission measure analysis. Magnetic extrapolations indicate that the sigmoid is consistent with formation by magnetic reconnection between previously existing J-shaped loops. The sigmoid experienced a fast and a slow cooling stages, both of which were dominated by conductive cooling. The estimated total cooling time of the sigmoid is shorter than the observed value. So, we proposed that the non-eruptive sigmoid, heated by the continuous magnetic reconnection, leads to the extremely energetic EUV late phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u9053\u4e862012\u5e746\u670817\u65e5\u4e00\u5bf9C\u7ea7\u8000\u6591\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u80fdEUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u6bd4\u4e3b\u5cf0\u671f\u9ad8\u51fa4.2\u500d\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u975e\u55b7\u53d1Sigmoid\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u78c1\u91cd\u8054\u52a0\u70ed\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u51b7\u5374\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "EUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u662f\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u671f\u95f4\u6696\u65e5\u5195\u7ebf\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u80fdEUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SDO\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u7684AIA\u4eea\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u53d1\u5c04\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76C\u7ea7\u8000\u6591\u7684EUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eSigmoid\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0EUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u5728\u6696\u6e29\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\uff082-3\u00d710^6 K\uff09\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3b\u5cf0\u671f\u9ad8\u51fa4.2\u500d\uff1bSigmoid\u7ed3\u6784\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc710^7 K\u540e\u51b7\u5374\u4ea7\u751fEUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u8f90\u5c04\uff1b\u51b7\u5374\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4f20\u5bfc\u51b7\u5374\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u603b\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u78c1\u91cd\u8054\u52a0\u70ed\u7684\u975e\u55b7\u53d1Sigmoid\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u80fd\u7684EUV\u665a\u671f\u76f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u8000\u6591\u540e\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Identification and redshift determination of 3500 bright QSOs", "comment": "24 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, submitted to A&A Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) special issue", "summary": "The slitless spectroscopy mode of the NISP onboard Euclid has enabled efficient spectroscopy of objects within a large FoV. We present a large and homogeneous sample of bright quasars identified from the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) by combining high-purity candidate selections from Gaia and WISE with the NISP spectra. Through visual inspection of the Euclid spectra of these quasar candidates, we identify approximately 3500 quasars with reliable redshifts at $0<z\\lesssim 4.8$. We generate the first Euclid composite spectrum of quasars covering rest-frame NUV to NIR wavelengths without telluric lines, which will be pivotal to NIR quasar spectral analysis. We obtain an empirical spectroscopic depth of $J_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.5$ and $H_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.3$ at the sensitivity of the Wide Field Survey, beyond which the number of securely identified quasars declines sharply. We analyse VIS morphologies using Sersic and CAS metrics, and a deep-learning PSF fraction to track nuclear dominance. At low redshift ($z<0.5$), obvious host structures are common and a single Sersic model fits about half of the sources; at intermediate redshift ($0.5<z<2$), the nuclear component dominates, with 90% of the Sersic fits saturating at the upper index limit. In this intermediate redshift regime, $f_{\\rm PSF}$ is available, and we use it as a more reliable compactness measure than the single-Sersic and CAS parameters to quantify nuclear versus host emission. We also explore the novel Euclid NIR colour space and discuss the role of these quasars in refining AGN selection techniques for future Euclid data releases. Our results highlight the potential of Euclid spectroscopy to advance quasar surveys and enable the construction of more complete AGN catalogues. The spectroscopic bright quasar catalogue of this work, and the composite quasar spectrum, will be available at https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/.

Submitted to ApJ. Comments and feedback welcome", "summary": "We constrain the formation history of the Milky Way bulge using a two-infall Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) framework implemented in the OMEGA++ code. We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6838\u7403\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7206\u53d1\u548c\u540e\u671f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u5408\u8d77\u6e90\u5047\u8bf4", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6838\u7403\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65e9\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u540e\u671f\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8d21\u732e", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OMEGA++\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u6052\u661f\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6838\u5408\u6210\u4ea7\u989d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cMCMC\u4f18\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u62df\u5408\u663e\u793a\u6838\u7403\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u6052\u661f\u7206\u53d1\uff08t1~0.1Gyr\uff0ctau1~0.09Gyr\uff0cSFE~3Gyr^-1\uff09\u548c\u540e\u671f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5438\u79ef\uff08t2~5.1Gyr\uff0ctau2~1.7Gyr\uff0csigma2~0.69\uff09\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u0394SFE~0.72\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u518d\u73b0\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bcc\u91d1\u5c5e\u5cf0\u548c[\u03b1/Fe]\u5728\u9ad8[Fe/H]\u5904\u7684\u4e0b\u964d", "conclusion": "\u6838\u7403\u5177\u6709\u590d\u5408\u8d77\u6e90\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178\u574d\u7f29\u5f62\u6210\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5e74\u8f7b\u6210\u5206\u5339\u914d\u665a\u671f\u5bcc\u96c6\uff1b\u5438\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u534f\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u53ea\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570"}}

Using broadband photospheric images obtained with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the properties of BPs have been analyzed with DKIST for the first time at the highest spatial resolutions achievable. BPs were observed to have an average lifetime of 95$\\pm$29 s and a mean transverse velocity of 1.60$\\pm$0.41 km/s. The BPs had a log-normal area distribution with a peak at 2300 km$^2$. Transverse velocity and lifetimes across the DKIST images were comparable and consistent with previous studies. The area distribution of the DKIST data peaked in areas significantly lower than those from the literature. This was explored further and was observed to be due to an overestimation of BP areas due to the merging of close features when the spatial resolution is reduced, in tandem with possible over-splitting of features in the DKIST images. Furthermore, the effect of variable seeing within the data was determined. This showed that the average spatial resolution of the data was around 0.''034$\\pm$0.''007 in comparison to the theoretical diffraction-limit of 0.''022. Accounting for the influence of seeing, the peak of the area distribution of BPs in the DKIST data was estimated as 4800 km$^2$, which is still significantly lower than previously observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528DKIST\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u9996\u6b21\u4ee5\u6700\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u4eae\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5e73\u5747\u5bff\u547d95\u00b129\u79d2\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea61.60\u00b10.41 km/s\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c2300 km\u00b2\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u89c6\u5b81\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u4e3a4800 km\u00b2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528DKIST\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7814\u7a76\u592a\u9633\u4eae\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0e\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DKIST\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5bbd\u5e26\u6210\u50cf\u4eea\u83b7\u53d6\u5149\u7403\u5c42\u5bbd\u5e26\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u4eae\u70b9\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u3001\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u5b81\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4eae\u70b9\u5e73\u5747\u5bff\u547d95\u00b129\u79d2\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea61.60\u00b10.41 km/s\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c2300 km\u00b2\u3002\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bff\u547d\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u503c\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u7279\u5f81\u5408\u5e76\u800c\u9ad8\u4f30\u9762\u79ef\uff0cDKIST\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u5b81\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ea60.034\u00b10.007\u89d2\u79d2\uff08\u7406\u8bba\u884d\u5c04\u6781\u96500.022\u89d2\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c\u4e3a4800 km\u00b2\uff0c\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "DKIST\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u4eae\u70b9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u8981\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u90bb\u8fd1\u7279\u5f81\u5408\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u9762\u79ef\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u592a\u9633\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eae\u70b9\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

While most astrochemists are oriented to observe molecules in the gas phase and reproduce their abundances by modeling the physical conditions of the medium, the microscopic dust particles wandering in the interstellar medium deserve the attention of a smaller community. Radiation and thermally-driven processes taking place in the bare dust, and particularly in dust particles covered by ice mantles, are mimicked in the laboratory. In addition to water, interstellar ice contains other simple species. In this Review we present our current knowledge on ice photochemistry and thermal processing that ultimately leads to formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). Numerous COMs are of astrobiological interest and match those present in comets and asteroids. Upon impact of these minor bodies, water and COMs were delivered to the earth and might have intervened in the first prebiotic reactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u661f\u9645\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u4e0a\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u5929\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u65e9\u671f\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5929\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6c14\u76f8\u5206\u5b50\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u73b0\u5176\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u53ca\u5176\u51b0\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u70ed\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6a21\u62df\u661f\u9645\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u4e0a\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6c34\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7b80\u5355\u7269\u79cd\u5728\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u661f\u9645\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5b50\u4e0e\u5f57\u661f\u548c\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6709\u673a\u7269\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5929\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u661f\u9645\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u4e0a\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u662f\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u5f57\u661f\u548c\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u649e\u51fb\u88ab\u8f93\u9001\u5230\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u9884\u751f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

We use a Bayesian modelling technique, Blobby3D, which accounts for seeing effects (beam smearing) and can model the substructures of the flux distribution. The median metallicity gradient of our sample is $\\nabla \\mathrm{[O/H]}=-0.013^{+0.059}_{-0.033}$ dex/kpc. Among the galaxies in our sample, 32.9% have negative metallicity gradients (2$\u03c3$ significance), 10.0% have positive gradients and 57.1% have flat gradients. The $\\nabla \\mathrm{[O/H]}$-$M_*$ relation of the MAGPI galaxies generally agrees with theoretical predictions, where a combination of stellar feedback, gas transport, and accretion shapes the metallicity profile, with the dominant processes varying with galaxy mass. We find a positive correlation between $\\nabla \\mathrm{[O/H]}$ and gas velocity dispersion ($r=0.36$), indicating that stronger gas turbulence is associated with flatter or inverted metallicity gradients, likely due to enhanced gas mixing. Additionally, smaller galaxies tend to have flatter or positive gradients, suggesting that metal dilution by gas accretion or removal via feedback-driven winds may outweigh metal enrichment in small galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8670\u4e2az~0.3\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7ea61/3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020\u91d1\u5c5e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u91d1\u5c5e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5851\u9020\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672fBlobby3D\u5206\u6790MAGPI\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6821\u6b63\u89c6\u5b81\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5149\u675f\u5c55\u5bbd\uff09\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u901a\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8670\u4e2az~0.3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3a-0.013 dex/kpc\uff1b32.9%\u661f\u7cfb\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c10.0%\u6709\u6b63\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c57.1%\u6709\u5e73\u5766\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u7b26\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.36\uff09\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u661f\u7cfb\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\u6216\u6b63\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u7531\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u968f\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6c14\u4f53\u6e4d\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u91d1\u5c5e\u6df7\u5408\u52a0\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5e73\u6216\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b\u5c0f\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u7a00\u91ca\u6216\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bcc\u96c6\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes. The observed properties of this sample are compared to the predictions from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), with attention given to the expected evolutionary pathways of stripped stars and the stellar and binary properties of both components of post-interaction systems across a range of initial conditions. Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed. An accurate description of prevalence of binary interaction, the physics of mass transfer, and the post-interaction configuration of systems over a range of initial conditions has far-reaching implications including double-degenerate binaries and their eventual mergers, the output of ionizing UV flux of stellar populations, and the supernova explosions that can arise from stripped or rapidly-rotating progenitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u4e2d\u665a\u671fB\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53cc\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0eBPASS\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u8bb8\u591a\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u65e9\u671fB\u578b\u661f\u662f\u53cc\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u665a\u671fB\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u661f\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e3a\u540e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5149\u8c31\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5355\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u53cc\u661f\u6837\u672c\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2d\u665a\u671fB\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u661f\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8fc7\u53bb\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6cB\u578b\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eBinary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS)\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5265\u79bb\u6052\u661f\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5206\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6052\u661f\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2d\u665a\u671fB\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u661f\u4e2d\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8fc7\u53bb\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9b\u4f53\u5265\u79bb\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5bfc\u81f4\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u7b80\u5e76\u53cc\u661f\u53ca\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u6052\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7535\u79bb\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u5265\u79bb\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u3002"}}

Among these, the time lags of Mg II have been successfully determined for 8 of the 18 objects, thereby expanding the current Mg II RM sample, particularly at higher accretion rates. By incorporating measurements of the line widths, we determine the masses of their central supermassive black holes. Based on these new measurements, we update the relation between the Mg II radius and the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 $\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ ($R_{\\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation), yielding a slope of $0.24 \\pm 0.03$, which is slightly shallower than, yet still consistent with, previously reported values. Similar to the H$\u03b2$ lines, the Mg II time lags in SEAMBHs are shorter than those of AGNs with normal accretion rates at comparable luminosities. The deviation of AGNs from the best-fit $R_{\\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation shows a strong correlation with the accretion rate, while no significant correlation is found between the deviation and the flux ratio of UV iron to Mg II.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b18\u4e2a\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d8\u4e2a\u7684Mg II\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86Mg II\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e3000\u00c5\u5355\u8272\u5149\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u6e90\u7684Mg II\u65f6\u5ef6\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u66f4\u77ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7b2c15\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55Mg II\u56de\u54cd\u6620\u5c04\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3Mg II\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf918\u4e2a\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u8fdb\u884c2017-2024\u5e74\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfMg II\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0Mg II\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e3000\u00c5\u5355\u8272\u5149\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u786e\u5b9a\u4e868\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7684Mg II\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387Mg II\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5f97\u5230R_MgII-L_3000\u5173\u7cfb\u659c\u7387\u4e3a0.24\u00b10.03\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u6e90\u7684Mg II\u65f6\u5ef6\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u66f4\u77ed\uff1b\u504f\u79bb\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eUV\u94c1/Mg II\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684Mg II\u56de\u54cd\u6620\u5c04\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86R_MgII-L_3000\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u5f71\u54cd\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u662f\u504f\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

The CO and CN measurements were used to probe CNO abundances of these stars, and elemental abundance values from the literature were used to identify the trends of [C/N] and [O/N] with CN and CO. To put these measurements in context, we performed stellar atmosphere fitting to obtain estimates of stellar parameters, with a primary focus on effective temperature. Our measurements and temperature estimates show that CN is significantly affected by dredge-up of processed material.

DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =< l=< 229.75 deg and |b| =< 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30\" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way.", "AI": {"tldr": "MWISP\u5de1\u5929\u9996\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5317\u90e8\u5e73\u97622310\u5e73\u65b9\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u542b12CO\u300113CO\u3001C18O\u5206\u5b50\u8c31\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u662f\u540c\u7c7b\u5de1\u5929\u4e2d\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eDBSCAN\u7b97\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e07\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u7ed8\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684CO\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u8c31\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PMO 13.7\u7c73\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8fdb\u884cOTF\u626b\u63cf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u94f6\u6cb3\u7ecf\u5ea69.75-229.75\u5ea6\u3001\u7eac\u5ea6\u00b15.25\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u4e09\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u503crms\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.47K\u30010.25K\u30010.25K\u768412CO\u300113CO\u3001C18O\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230103,517\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d10,790\u4e2a\u670913CO\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c304\u4e2a\u6709C18O\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u603b12CO\u901a\u91cf\u4e3a7.69\u00b10.38\u00d710^7 K km/s arcmin\u00b2\u3002", "conclusion": "MWISP DR1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5317\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\uff0cDBSCAN\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b7\u4e8682%\u7684\u603b12CO\u901a\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, the excitation processes of OH remain poorly characterized. We provide a new set of collisional rate coefficients for OH with H$_2$, expanding the existing data to $j$ levels up to $j=15/2$ and temperatures up to 750 K. These rate coefficients are obtained from state-to-state collision cross sections calculated by means of well-converged close-coupling quantum scattering calculations for collisions of OH with para- and ortho-H$_2$ with energies up to 1700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\simeq 2450$ K). We reproduce the rate coefficients computed by Klos et al. (2017) and extend their results to higher temperatures and higher rotational levels of OH. The de-excitation rate coefficients are lower in collisions with para-H$_2$ ($j_{\\rm H_2} = 0$) due to the absence of a quadrupole moment, but this difference decreases at higher temperatures. We find that the rate coefficients follow scaling relations with the energy gap between the upper and lower levels of a given transition, which allows extrapolation to higher OH rotational states $j_{\\rm OH}$. As a first application, we show that under astrophysical conditions typical of warm and dense gas around nascent stars, the populations of low-$j_{\\rm OH}$ states are dominated by collisions, even when chemical pumping is included.

However, while we have ample, homogeneous data for galaxies with halo masses $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ the data available for low-mass galaxies is more sparse, and both GCS mass and halo mass estimates are determined using varying methodologies. This work compiles all available literature data for dwarf galaxies with confident stellar mass and GC count estimates, and converts these estimates to GCS masses and peak halo masses using a standard conversion. This allows for a consistent comparison of these masses to be made and a complete study of the behaviour of the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation to be conducted. We compare the positions of classical dwarfs on the scaling relation to that of ultra diffuse galaxies and extremely low-surface brightness galaxies and find that these non-classical dwarfs have, on average, systematically higher GC specific frequencies. This also makes them, on average, systematically positively offset from the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation, driving much of the high-$M_{GCS}$ scatter observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u5f25\u6563\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u6781\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6bd4\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u5728M_GCS-M_h\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6b63\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u661f\u7cfb\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u5df2\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff08\u6655\u8d28\u91cfM_h\u227210^10 M\u2299\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u7406\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76M_GCS-M_h\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7aef\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u6587\u732e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6570\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684M_GCS-M_h\u5173\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u5f25\u6563\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u6781\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6bd4\u9891\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u4eec\u5728M_GCS-M_h\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6b63\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u79fb\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9ad8M_GCS\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dM_GCS-M_h\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6027\u8d28\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u504f\u79bb\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Their low-redshift counterparts offer a unique opportunity to study the physical conditions that enable high ionizing-photon escape fractions. We present a robust method to photometrically identify EELGs in the J-PAS survey, which provides 56 optical bands over 8500 deg^2. Using data from a fully observed 30 deg^2 region, we combine narrow-band equivalent widths with machine-learning techniques to select galaxies with emission lines above 300 \u00c5. The method achieves 95% purity and 96% completeness for $i_\\mathrm{SDSS}<22.5$ mag. We identify 917 EELGs up to $z=0.8$; spectroscopic cross-matching with DESI/DR1 confirms the reliability of our redshifts and emission-line measurements. The selected galaxies show strong correlations between $\u03be_\\mathrm{ion}$ and EW([OIII]), consistent with previous low- and high-z studies.

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z>3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6696\u7535\u79bb\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7TNG50\u548cSERRA\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u5916\u6d41\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u62df\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u7b26\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "JWST/NIRSpec\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb(z>3)\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6696\u7535\u79bb\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u7387(25-40%)\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u5916\u6d41\u6c14\u4f53\u5e94\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u6d41\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TNG50\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df(\u7ea660000\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\uff0cz=3-5)\u548cSERRA\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u62df(\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\uff0cz=4-5)\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8303\u56f4Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eJWST/JADES NIRSpec\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0eJWST/JADES\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u7b26(\u7ea60.5dex\u5185)\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u62df\u503c\u7565\u9ad8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5149\u5b66\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u4ec5\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u591a\u76f8\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u5916\u6d41\u901f\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u503c\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002TNG50\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1a\u6b63\u9762\u671d\u5411\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u63a2\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u4fa7\u9762\u671d\u5411\u9ad8\u7ea615%\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u76d8\u72b6\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u589e\u81f3\u8fd140%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u5916\u6d41\u63a2\u6d4b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6b63\u9762\u671d\u5411\u661f\u7cfb\u66f4\u6613\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Due to the faint and irregular morphology of these galaxies, the default photometry is often inaccurate. Therefore, we utilized The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data to perform careful photometric measurements, and find that the low HI mass galaxies have similar stellar mass densities to dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. Compared to other dwarf galaxy populations, the HI-selected dwarfs exhibit higher stellar mass densities than ultradiffuse galaxies, and similar densities to HI-selected low-surface-brightness galaxies, albeit with lower stellar masses, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection among these populations. By classifying the galaxies according to their HI spectral-line profiles, we show that the double-peaked sources conform closely to the Tully-Fisher relation, whereas the single-peaked sources follow the Faber-Jackson relation but with large scatter. This indicates that the single-peaked systems are likely dispersion dominated and that the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass in such systems may remain consistent across both low- and high-mass regimes. These findings suggest that HI-selected dwarf galaxies with single-peaked HI profiles may share a similar dynamical state with massive ellipticals, offering new insights into their structural evolution and the diversity of formation pathways for low-mass galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAST\u5de1\u5929\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4f4eHI\u8d28\u91cf\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u77ee\u692d\u5706\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5355\u5cf0HI\u8c31\u7ebf\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u692d\u5706\u661f\u7cfb\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4eHI\u8d28\u91cf\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08M_HI < 10^8 M_\u2299\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528FAST\u5168\u5929\u7a7aHI\u5de1\u5929\uff08FASHI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4f4eHI\u8d28\u91cf\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DECaLS\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u5149\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6839\u636eHI\u8c31\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5c06\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u4e3a\u53cc\u5cf0\u548c\u5355\u5cf0\u4e24\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4f4eHI\u8d28\u91cf\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u77ee\u692d\u5706\u661f\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u53cc\u5cf0\u6e90\u7b26\u5408Tully-Fisher\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5355\u5cf0\u6e90\u7b26\u5408Faber-Jackson\u5173\u7cfb\u4f46\u5f25\u6563\u8f83\u5927\uff1b\u5355\u5cf0\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u5cf0HI\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684HI\u9009\u62e9\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u692d\u5706\u661f\u7cfb\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Rubin Observatory, is a wide-field multi-band survey that will revolutionize our understanding of extragalactic sources through its unprecedented combination of area and depth. While the LSST survey strategy is still being finalized, the Rubin Observatory team has generated a series of survey simulations using the LSST Operations Simulator to explore the optimal survey strategy that best accommodates the majority of scientific goals. In this study, we utilize the latest simulated data to predict the number of detectable quasars by LSST in each band and evaluate the impact of different survey strategies. We find that the number of quasars and lower luminosity AGNs detected in the baseline strategy (v4.3.1) in the redshift range z=0.3-6.7 will be highest in the i-band and lowest in the u-band. Over 70% of quasars are expected to be detected within the first year in all bands, as LSST will have already reached the break of the luminosity function at most redshifts. With a limiting magnitude of 25.7 mag, we expect to detect 184 million AGNs in the z-band over the 10-year survey, with quasars constituting only 6% of the total AGNs in each band. This arises because, considering that the luminosities of most low-luminosity AGNs are affected by contamination from their host galaxies, we set a magnitude threshold when predicting the number of quasars. We find that variations in the u-band strategy can impact the number of quasar detections. Specifically, the difference between the baseline strategy and that with the largest total exposure in u is 15%. In contrast, changes in rolling strategies, DDF strategies, weather conditions, and Target of Opportunity observations result in variations below 2%.

Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $\u03c4_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528LightGBM\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u536b\u661f\u843d\u5165\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eA-SLOTH\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u03c490\u3001[Fe/H]\u548cM\u22c6\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u6709\u5148\u524d\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u6210\u5458\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u536b\u661f\uff0c\u5728A-SLOTH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747MSE 5.04\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5c42\u6b21\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u5b83\u4eec\u843d\u5165\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\u4e14\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LightGBM\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eA-SLOTH\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u768430\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u03c490\uff08\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3001[Fe/H]\uff08\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff09\u548cM\u22c6\uff08\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u6709\u5148\u524d\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u6210\u5458\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u536b\u661f\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728A-SLOTH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee5.04\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728CVn II\u548cUMa I\u7b49\u5c11\u6570\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u5148\u524d\u843d\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u536b\u661f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9996\u6b21\u843d\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7684MSE\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u81f31.66\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6700\u65e9\u843d\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u6dec\u706d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LightGBM\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u536b\u661f\u7684\u843d\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6700\u65e9\u843d\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present multiwavelength results for one of the targets, the nearby high-mass star-forming region W40. Using dense-gas tracers C$^{18}$O(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), we identified six velocity-coherent filaments: five at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,7.5\\kms\\! and one at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,5\\kms. Four of these converge towards an infrared-bright cluster hosting the most massive star of the region (IRS 1A South, O9.5V), forming a hub-filament system (HFS). Key physical parameters, including filament lengths, widths, masses, velocity dispersions, and line masses, are derived. Five dense clumps traced by N$_2$H$^+$(1--0) exhibit subsonic to transonic turbulence, contrasting with the supersonic motions of their parental filaments, indicating turbulence dissipation. A deficit of emission at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,7\\kms\\! in several molecular lines, along with a blueshifted absorption dip in the HCN(1--0) profile, suggests that emission from OB-heated gas is being absorbed by a cold foreground cloud. A bridge-like feature in position-velocity space connects the \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,5 and $\\sim$\\,7.5\\kms\\! filaments, and spatially coinciding with dense condensations and radio continuum peaks. These findings suggest that a past interaction--likely a cloud-cloud collision--triggered the formation of HFS and ultimately the central massive cluster.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRESTORM\u9879\u76ee\u7814\u7a76W40\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b06\u6761\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d4\u6761\u5f62\u6210\u67a2\u7ebd-\u4e1d\u72b6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u56e2\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u6e4d\u6d41\u8017\u6563\u3001\u51b7\u524d\u666f\u4e91\u5438\u6536\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e91-\u4e91\u78b0\u649e\u89e6\u53d1\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "FIRESTORM\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9W40\u8fd9\u4e00\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81f4\u5bc6\u6c14\u4f53\u793a\u8e2a\u5242C\u00b9\u2078O(1-0)\u548cH\u00b9\u00b3CO\u207a(1-0)\u8bc6\u522b\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7N\u2082H\u207a(1-0)\u8ffd\u8e2a\u81f4\u5bc6\u56e2\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u8c31\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa6\u6761\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d5\u6761\u5728~7.5 km/s\uff0c1\u6761\u5728~5 km/s\u30024\u6761\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6c47\u805a\u5f62\u6210\u67a2\u7ebd-\u4e1d\u72b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u81f4\u5bc6\u56e2\u5757\u663e\u793a\u4e9a\u58f0\u901f\u5230\u8de8\u58f0\u901f\u6e4d\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u6bcd\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u8d85\u58f0\u901f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6e4d\u6d41\u8017\u6563\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u52307 km/s\u5904\u53d1\u5c04\u7f3a\u5931\u548cHCN\u8c31\u7ebf\u84dd\u79fb\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u51b7\u524d\u666f\u4e91\u5438\u6536\u3002\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u901f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6865\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u4e2a\u901f\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5206\uff0c\u4e0e\u81f4\u5bc6\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u5cf0\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "W40\u533a\u57df\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e91-\u4e91\u78b0\u649e\u53ef\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u67a2\u7ebd-\u4e1d\u72b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}
