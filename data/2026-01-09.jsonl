The continuous TESS coverage allows us to characterise its frequent outbursts with unprecedented detail, providing the first comprehensive study of an AM CVn during outbursts and enabling detailed modelling of these systems. The superoutbursts in KL Dra generally include a precursor, and are followed by a series of rebrightenings after which a sequence of 3-4 large amplitude normal outbursts is observed. We fit parametric profiles to each superoutburst component (precursor, rise to plateau, plateau, decay), to rebrightenings, and to normal outbursts, which let us quantify every high state feature and investigate correlations with the system's long term supercyle evolution. Our continuous coverage reveals an average value for the supercycles, superoutbursts and normal outbursts of $60.4 \\pm 0.1$ d, $5.67\\pm0.03$ d and $1.17 \\pm0.01$ d, respectively. The supercycle duration may be correlated with the rebrightenings duration and superoutburst amplitude, and anticorrelated with the plateau length. Within a supercycle, normal outbursts grow in amplitude and duration, and the first normal outburst is usually highly asymmetric, while subsequent normal outbursts are more symmetric. We detected superhumps in TESS superoutbursts but not in the rebrightenings or normal outbursts. We interpret the results within the disk instability model, considering additional effects, such as changes in the donor mass transfer rate."}

Despite the ubiquity of this wave phenomenon, its driving mechanism remains unclear. Studies to derive the polarization state of these oscillations, which would be a key to identifying the drivers, have been limited due to observational constraints. We analyze a 3D MHD simulation of coronal loops using the MURaM code. Synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission maps, combined with velocity diagnostics, are used to identify and characterize transverse wave motions in the simulated loop structures. This is the first demonstration of decayless kink waves emerging self-consistently in a 3D MHD loop-in-a-box model. The simulation produces persistent, low-amplitude, decayless kink oscillations that closely match observed properties. These oscillations arise spontaneously, without any imposed periodic driver, and exhibit clear linear polarization with oscillation planes not aligned to the principal axes. The observed coherency of linear polarization with oscillation cycles favors a self-sustained or quasi-steady type wave driver over a stochastic or broadband source."}

Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity.

Only the abundance pattern of V457 Cyg suggests depletion. In the spectrum of this star, TiO lines are also observed in emission in addition to metal emissions. V457 Cyg is likely a binary system that was once surrounded by a circumbinary disc. In the spectrum of V894 Per, we find a set of spectral lines that appear to belong to another star, corroborating that it is an eclipsing variable rather than an RV Tauri star. The high overabundance of sodium may result from mass transfer within the binary system."}

We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies.\n  Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence.\n  Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems.\n  Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals. The best alignment between our models and structures observed in local barred galaxies is achieved by assuming a sound speed of $c_s=20\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$."}

However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(γ)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\\rm BP}$, $G_{\\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $γ_λ$ values between the short- $(0.4 \\leq \\log{P} < 1)$ and long-period $(1 \\leq \\log{P} < 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $γ_λ$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study."}

The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b."}

Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications."}

Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object.\n  Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling.\n  Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms.\n  Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux."}

Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $α$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $α$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars."}

For both detectors, our analysis demonstrates charge losses at the center of the spectral trace and charge excesses at the trace edges. We find that the NRS1 detector displays ~3x larger deviations from linearity compared to NRS2. Given the large transit (~1.5%) and eclipse (~0.5%) signals for WASP-121b, we also investigate variations in the distribution of charge throughout the time-series observation.

Such conditions are typically encountered in a zone between the 4:1 resonance and corotation. The purpose of our study is to understand the gaseous flow in the aforementioned environment and trace the morphology of the shocks that form. We use two conceptually different hydrodynamic schemes for our calculations, namely, the mesh-free Lagrangian SPH method and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This allows us to compare responses by means of the two algorithms. We find that the big loops of the orbits, mainly belonging to the x1 stable periodic orbits, do not help the shock loci to approach corotation. They deviate away from the regions occupied by the loops, bypass them and form extensions at an angle with the straight-line shocks. Roughly at the distance from the center at which we start to observe the big loops, we find characteristic \"tails\" of dense gas streaming towards the straight-line shocks.

There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au.

In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly.

This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate."}

Using this refined catalog, we perform aperture photometry on the SINGS narrowband H$α$ images of NGC 7331, extracting the H$α$ luminosity L(H$α$) of these regions. We present corresponding measurements of the average line-of-sight ionized gas velocity dispersion $σ$ in these HII regions with CH$α$S. High-resolution velocity and dispersion maps of the galactic disk are produced from the CH$α$S spectral imaging, selecting spaxels with high signal to noise in order to measure velocity dispersions as low as 12 km s$^{-1}$. Our measurements of the L(H$α$), $\\rm Σ_{SFR}$ and $σ$ in NGC 7331 are consistent with spatially resolved observations of HII regions in large surveys of nearby galaxies. We explore the L(H$α$)$- σ$ relationship, identifying turbulent HII regions with nonthermal dispersions likely driven by stellar feedback. The dispersion is correlated with the star formation rate surface density, and using the relation $\\rm σ\\propto εΣ_{SFR}^α$, HII regions in NGC 7331 are best fit by $ε= 80$ , $α=0.285$."}

However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $κ$. For $κ\\gtrsim 0.4\\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $κ\\sim 0.025\\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs."}

Here, we analysed high-spectral-resolution ALMA observations of the CO (J=3-2) line obtained on 25 May 2018, sampling Saturn's limb from 20°S to 69°N. CO vertical profiles were retrieved using a line-by-line radiative transfer model combined with spectral inversion techniques, testing multiple prior scenarios representative of different source hypotheses. CO is confined to a narrow layer between 0.1 and 1 mbar, with a robust negative vertical gradient and mean abundances of (3.7+/- 0.8) x 10$^{-8}$ at 0.1 mbar and (7.2 +/- 0.9) x 10$^{-8}$ at 1 mbar. The meridional distribution is statistically homogeneous, with a marginal enhancement near 60° N plausibly related to Enceladus. No significant equatorial enhancement is detected. The absence of a strong equatorial enhancement rules out a long-lived steady source associated with ring infall. The observations are most consistent with a relatively recent ($\\approx$200-year-old or younger) cometary impact whose material has since been horizontally mixed, while any Cassini Grand Finale ring influx was either too recent or inefficient to affect CO abundances at the probed pressure levels."}

The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere.

To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources."}

Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications."}

For both detectors, our analysis demonstrates charge losses at the center of the spectral trace and charge excesses at the trace edges. We find that the NRS1 detector displays ~3x larger deviations from linearity compared to NRS2. Given the large transit (~1.5%) and eclipse (~0.5%) signals for WASP-121b, we also investigate variations in the distribution of charge throughout the time-series observation.

To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities.\n  Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification.

With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$α$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN.

Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $α$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure.

Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales.

This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO."}

However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $κ$. For $κ\\gtrsim 0.4\\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $κ\\sim 0.025\\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs."}

Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host. Using simulated Roman data, we show that our method has extremely small systematic errors and significantly less random noise than if we subtracted a single perfectly aligned spectrum of the host obtained before or after the supernova was visible."}

We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $μ$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\\pm0.2$ for $z>1.5$, but rises to $4.0\\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\\approx2$ and dominates at $z\\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\\pm0.1$ at $z=0$. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems."}

Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $α$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $α$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars."}

Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\\pm8$ pc and $56\\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge."}

However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(γ)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\\rm BP}$, $G_{\\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $γ_λ$ values between the short- $(0.4 \\leq \\log{P} < 1)$ and long-period $(1 \\leq \\log{P} < 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $γ_λ$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study."}

There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly.
