To reduce spectral structure in the antenna beam associated with ground scattering, EIGSEP uses a shaped bowtie antenna suspended in a canyon 100 m above the ground. We describe the current system design of EIGSEP, including the rotating antenna platform, a transmitter antenna to characterise the beam of the bowtie antenna, and auxiliary ground antennas. We then discuss the EIGSEP calibration scheme, which incorporates traditional Dicke switching in the receiver, and novel approaches that include beam mapping, beam modulation, and interferometric cross-correlation. The instrument has been deployed near Marjum Pass, Utah, for testing and initial data collection. We discuss the site characteristics and present initial field measurements."}

However, this progress has largely neglected the significant constraints on the interior of Saturn's structure imposed by the observed oscillation frequencies in its rings. Here, we study initial conditions for Saturn's evolution that, after $4.56\\;\\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, give rise to planetary structures admitting oscillation frequencies consistent with those observed via Saturn's ring seismology. Restricting our attention to models without compact rocky cores, we achieve simultaneous good agreement with most observed properties of Saturn at the level of current evolutionary models and with key frequencies in the observed oscillation spectrum. Our preliminary work suggests that Saturn's interior stably stratified region may be moderately less extended ($\\sim 0.4$--$0.5R_{\\rm Sat}$) than previously thought, which is important for reconciling the seismic constraints with evolutionary models. We also tentatively find that the deep helium gradients inferred by previous, static structural modelling of Saturn's ring seismology may not be required to reproduce the observed seismology data."}

Grogin"], "title": "Serial Charge Transfer Efficiency in ACS/WFC", "comment": "28 pages, 20 figures", "summary": "We present a dedicated study of CCD serial ($x$-direction) charge transfer efficiency (CTE) in ACS/WFC. Following past studies of parallel ($y$-direction) CTE, we use the serial CTE trails behind hot pixels in calibration dark frames to characterize charge trapping and release in the serial registers of the WFC detectors. Serial CTE trails are sharper and longer than parallel CTE trails. Many fewer charge traps come into play during serial pixel transfers than parallel transfers, which explains why parallel CTE is much worse than serial CTE. We find that serial CTE can cause losses of $\\sim$0.005-0.02~mag in stellar photometry and shift stellar centroids by $\\sim$0.01-0.035 pixels. The pixel-based algorithm in CALACS that corrects for parallel CTE losses in WFC data has been modified to include a correction for serial CTE losses. The PCTETAB reference file has also been updated to include serial CTE parameters. The pixel-based correction for serial CTE currently runs only on full-frame WFC images obtained after SM4 (May 2009). Shortly following the publication of this report, science data corrected for both parallel and serial CTE will be available in the MAST archive."}

The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to \\b{eta} Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems."}

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $μ$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\\gtrsim$1.5 $μ$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features.

These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region."}

Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits."}

It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve."}

They are believed to be the products of stellar mergers, but the exact origin and formation channel remain unclear. We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales. Our follow-up photometry has also discovered pulsations in the second and third hydrogen-dominated DAQ white dwarfs, one hotter than 15,500 K, possibly extending the boundaries of the DAV instability strip for white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers."}

Properties and performance of the NISP signal estimator", "comment": null, "summary": "The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations."}

With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets. In this chapter we explore some of the key physical and chemical transitions that differentiate ultra-hot Jupiters from their colder counterparts and highlight the unique opportunities arising from probing their atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy."}

To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $Σ_{\\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas."}

The observation series span 220 nights from 2013 to 2024. During the observation period, the star's brightness varied within the range of V=9-11 mag. The rotation axis of the \"star + accretion disk\" system is tilted at a large angle, so the line of sight intersects the wind region and accreting flows in the star's magnetosphere. Variability in the short-wavelength wing of the Halpha emission line and the profile of the D NaI resonance doublet are analyzed. It is shown that the wind and accretion flows vary on a time scale of approximately 20 days. When the predominant flow direction changes, a time lag is observed: initially, accretion increases, and after two days, absorption in the line-of-sight wind decreases. It is concluded that the spectral line profiles are formed in the magnetospheric accretion flows and the conical wind originating from the boundary of the star's magnetosphere. The time lag is determined by the tilt of the magnetic dipole and the opening angle of the conical wind. It is assumed that RY Tau operates in an unstable propeller mode, and fluctuations in the accretion and wind flows are caused by density waves in the accretion disk."}

In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\\sim$20-70\\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems. However, for the Coax radiation-hydrodynamics problem, we see that MOC is approximately two to three times slower than IMC-DDMC and S$_n$ in its current implementation."}

We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample.

Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$σ$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$σ$, over $0<z<4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $Ω_{\\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal.

In the quiet Sun, the spatially averaged line profile shows a red asymmetry and a redshift of the line center. It is known that the effect of isotopic splitting must be taken into account in the forward modeling to reproduce the observed asymmetry. So far, no numerical model could match an average observed line profile in terms of the line width and asymmetry. Our goal is to investigate how well a simulation computed with the chromospheric extension of the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) reproduces the spatially averaged Ca ii 854.2 nm line profile. We aim to determine the contributions from the isotopic splitting versus the dynamics in the atmosphere to the resulting line width and asymmetry. We solve the radiative transfer problem three times, once considering only the most abundant isotope of calcium in the atmosphere, once taking six calcium isotopes into account, and finally using a single composite atom model. We find the forward modeled spatially and temporally averaged spectra to be in good agreement with an average observation of the quiet Sun. In order to match the observed line width, the simulated atmosphere must be sufficiently dynamic. The typical red asymmetry can only be reproduced by taking the isotopic splitting effect into account, as suggested in the literature."}

Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications."}

The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $χ^2_\\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\\text{rim}\\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\\text{out}\\lesssim6$ au) around the primary.

We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are \"locally unbound\" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes."}

Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample."}

In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue.

Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate.

To validate our methodology we present results from simulated rotational splittings, whether including or not random noise commensurable with the current observational precision. We also describe how we leverage the fact that one of our methodologies uses an initial guess that can be chosen to include a priori information. In order to try to resolve the tachocline, we increased the radial density of the inversion grid and showed how it affect the inferences. We also show how the trade off between smoothing and noise magnification affects these, as well as the effectiveness of using an informed initial guess. Results derived from high-precision rotational splittings show clearly that the location of the tachocline at low latitudes is different for its position at high latitudes. The latitudinal variation of its width is not significantly constrained, but our results agree with estimates based on forward modeling. When using splittings derived from somewhat shorter time series, we find temporal variations that are neither definitive nor significant, since we see systematic differences when using different methodologies."}

The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to \\b{eta} Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems."}

Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \\pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H]~$= -0.8 \\pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$σ$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained."}

This overview describes the survey's design, target selection, and science goals, and highlights some first results using these data. In the inner regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), the survey obtained high-resolution near-infrared APOGEE spectra (S/N~45) of ~14,000 bright, oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB-O) stars. These data provide contiguous spatial coverage of the Clouds' main bodies, enabling detailed chemo-dynamical studies. To explore extended structures, the survey includes BOSS optical spectroscopy of fainter red giant (RG) stars selected with \\gaia~DR3 data, reaching G~17.5. Many of these targets extend to the outer regions of the Clouds, which are known to span ~20 deg (LMC) and ~12 deg(SMC) and contain diffuse substructures of unclear origin. BOSS data in the inner regions also complement APOGEE by providing elements inaccessible in the near-infrared and enabling cross-calibration between instruments. The survey further includes APOGEE and BOSS observations of ~300 evolved massive stars and a small sample of symbiotic binaries previously observed by APOGEE-1 and -2, enhancing our understanding of massive stellar evolution and complementing the SDSS-V main-sequence massive star program."}

III (proto)star at redshift $z \\sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $<100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\\sim 27$ M$_{\\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe."}

However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect.\n  Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population.\n  Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects.\n  Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales.\n  Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations. Moreover, with current computational power, its exclusion from simulations can not be justified."}

This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the \"synchronized pair\" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\\ast \\sim 10^{8-9}M_\\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \\sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe."}

We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $μ$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios."}

Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample."}

We also find new, but expected trends such as that the total mass in planets increases with stellar mass, and that observed planetary system masses show an upper limit that is roughly consistent with expectations from the stability of circumstellar disks. We tentatively identify potential unique trends in the host stars of super-puffs and hot jupiters and a possible subdivision of the class of hot jupiter systems.

In this work, we revisit the analysis using the deeper MUSE Extremely Deep Field (MXDF) data and an automated detection algorithm tailored to identify such features.

This outcome is nevertheless informative, as it (1) highlights the inherent challenges in detecting IMBHs, and (2) demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for future systematic searches, even though it did not yield a positive outcome in this case."}

The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}~M_\\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\\times10^{-10}$, and $4\\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO.

Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars.

There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems."}

We review the MSD when one needs to model more lens planes, each one with an internal mass sheet. We take into account the non-linear lens-lens coupling and line of sight effects, the latter treated as external mass sheets with associated shear. If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes. Even when including time delays from all sources, a residual degeneracy involving time delays, mass sheets and $ H_0 $ remains. We develop a framework which shows what can actually be constrained in multiple plane lens systems."}

With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work."}

When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$α$, lower [O III]/H$β$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra."}

The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$δ$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\\,M_\\odot$.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $α= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys."}

We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002--2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism."}

We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\\rm 1mm}=0.99\\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\\rm e,1mm}=0.73\\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\\pm0.01$ kpc).

The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($τ_{\\rm dep} \\sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe."}

Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate.

The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($σ(|v_{pec}|)_\\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\\ σ_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR} - Σ_\\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching."}

Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits."}

(2025) using ALMA. Toward this source, a variety of molecular species, including complex organic molecules (COMs: CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) are detected. The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources."}

We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample.

Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images. To this end, we used Illustris TNG50, one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date, allowing us to generate LSST-like mock images with a depth $\\sim$ 29 ${\\rm mag\\,arcsec^{-2}}$ for low-redshift ($z=0.16$) galaxies, with labeling based on their merger status as ground truth.

After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\\%.

The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $χ^2_\\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\\text{rim}\\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\\text{out}\\lesssim6$ au) around the primary.

We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the \"reflex motion\") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo."}

A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region."}

In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe."}

Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits."}

In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic."}

We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales.

We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample."}

Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe."}

We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $μ$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios."}

These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region."}
