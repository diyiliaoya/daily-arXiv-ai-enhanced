Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass ($\\log(M_{*} / M_{\\odot}) = 11.15 \\pm 0.16$) and redshift ($z_{\\text{phot}} = 3.62_{-0.04}^{+0.06}$) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be $μ_{\\text{max}} = 3.2$, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least $λ_{\\text{Edd}}^{\\text{intrinsic}} > 4.9$. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among $z>5$ supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe."}

For submission to the Open Journal of Astrophysics", "summary": "We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for evidence of a correlation between radio variability and the detection of astrophysical neutrinos. We find an excess number of associations between flaring radio sources and neutrinos that were detected between the first and second VLASS observations at $>2σ$ confidence. This excess is consistent with radio flares contributing $\\sim13\\,\\%$ of the astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. Notably $>80\\,\\%$ of the radio flares associated with neutrinos are not detected at either $γ$-ray or X-ray wavelengths, highlighting the importance of radio observations for identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. No excess in the number of associations between the wider radio-variable population and the IceCube neutrinos is seen when no time constraint is placed on the neutrino detection. We predict that data from future VLASS epochs will see an excess number of associations between radio flares and neutrinos at the $>3σ$ level, and expected improvements to the positional constraints on the neutrinos may increase that confidence to $>5σ$, should our results be representative."}
