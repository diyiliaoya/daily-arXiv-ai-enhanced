In this case, the higher the variations of $L_z$ of the orbit over a certain period of time, the higher the chaos of the orbit. In essence, a new method for analyzing orbital dynamics -- regular or chaotic -- is proposed. A high level of correlation between the results of orbit classification by the proposed method and the results of classification by other methods is shown. As a result, a sample of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc is divided into regular, chaotic, and weakly chaotic."}

However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this \"outskirt mass\" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data."}

Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% ($\\sim10^{-4}\\rm Mpc^{-3}$) at $z\\sim4$. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning $M_*=10^8-10^{10.5}\\rm M_\\odot$. A population of galaxies with $M_*<10^9\\rm M_\\odot$ appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions ($M_{\\rm vir} > 10^{11.5}\\rm M_\\odot$, $M_* > 10^{9.5}\\rm M_\\odot$), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection.

LRDs host lighter MBHs ($\\sim 10^{6.5}\\rm M_\\odot$) than non-LRDs ($\\sim 10^{7.5}\\rm M_\\odot$), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks.

We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$.

Under review at ApJ. Comments welcome!", "summary": "A widely explored pathway for hot Jupiter (HJ) formation is high-eccentricity migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by an exterior companion. However, for a distant or low-mass companion, this mechanism typically demands that the planet's initial orbit be very nearly perpendicular to that of the companion. In previous work (Yang et al. 2025), we demonstrated that such fine-tuning can be circumvented in the HAT-P-7 system due to the presence of an intermediate body that efficiently couples the orbits of the planet and the distant companion -- a mechanism we termed the eccentricity cascade (EC). In this work, we analytically characterize the dynamics governing the EC and delineate the parameter space within which it effectively operates. Our qualitative results are as follows: (i) The proto-HJ's eccentricity is most efficiently excited when the inner triple is on the verge of dynamical instability, (ii) the addition of a distant fourth body allows this instability to be approached gradually, and (iii) the instability mechanism is closely related to the stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets in binaries. By deriving an analytic criterion for S-type instability, we obtain closed-form expressions describing the onset of the EC. Our results show that efficient HJ formation via the EC occurs across a broad range of intermediate perturbers, highlighting its potential as a robust migration channel."}

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries."}

Also, we provide a finer sampling in Teff for Teff lower than 7000 K. This finer grid allows for more accurate interpolation of colours and in many cases it makes not necessary to compute a new model atmosphere, since one of the grid can be used directly. A total of 51663 model atmospheres and emergent fluxes have been computed.

To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~<~\\log(M_{\\star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot})~<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program.

We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$α$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\\simeq3$. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the H$α$-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation."}

Like other young planets, TOI-6448 b lands in a region of parameter space with few older planets. While just one data point, this fits with prior findings of an excess of 5-11Re planets around young stars far beyond what can be explained by reduced sensitivity at young ages.

Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes.

We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of $ξ_{\\mathrm{ion,0}}$ for 12 exceptionally bright ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\sim -22$ mag) star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime.

This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character."}

To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement.

We present observations of the corona acquired with the newly commissioned infrared slit spectropolarimeter Cryo-NIRSP at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), Haleakala, Hawaii to study the high frequency wave behavior in closed, active-region structures. Cryo-NIRSP observes the corona off the limb in the Fe XIII 1074 and 1079 nm forbidden atomic lines. The large aperture of DKIST allows us to explore the active region corona with temporal resolution faster than a second with an achieved spatial resolution of 2-5 arcseconds. Enhanced wave power is observed in the power spectra up to 100 mHz. Furthermore, we report on a statistically significant anti-correlation between the Fe XIII 1074 nm peak line intensity and line width in our data, possibly pointing to the presence of compressive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes. These observations show how the powerful spectropolarimetric capabilities of DKIST offer great promise for furthering our knowledge of coronal MHD waves."}

Spanning the natural mass range", "comment": null, "summary": "While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\\sim100\\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\\geq 10^8 M_\\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Few gas giants have been observed in their accretion phase. ELT instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, allowing detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph with a resolution R = 1e5. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible to METIS, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local NLTE shock-emission calculations. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction, appropriate for gas giants in gaps, and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion. We use resolved photospheric models, and include detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. When the accretion onto PDS 70 b is at its maximum observed strength, the Br a line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum, which is modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, making the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already only the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR = 12 in 4 h, and for the fiducial accretion rate, the line peak will have a per-bin SNR = 28 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 10 min to reach SNR = 3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to ELT/METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of accreting planets, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work."}

Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA)."}

The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios."}

The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.\n  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.\n  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends.

Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies."}

Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \\sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \\ge 10^4 M_{\\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial \"structure\" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations.

To effectively identify their atmospheric composition, we first must understand their geological evolution. For this study, we focus on enhancing an existing atmosphere-interior exchange model by incorporating additional geological processes relevant to rocky planets. We have extended the model to include the carbon cycle, which enables the model to track four key gas species - CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, and H$_2$ - across four planetary reservoirs: the mantle, plate, ocean, and atmosphere. Major features added include surface temperature calculations which are crucial for the carbon cycle, oxygen fugacity as a planetary interior parameter in the model, and oxidation reactions and diffusion-limited escape calculations to the atmosphere portion of the model. We successfully validated the model for Earth and applied this model to study the effect of oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance on TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f. Our results for present-day abundances show that oxygen fugacity significantly affects the partial pressures of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ for all three planets with minor effects for CO on two of the planets. We also found that H$_2$ is strongly dependent on water mass fraction (WMF). The addition of atmospheric processes produced a significant difference in the H$_2$ and CO abundances at present-day. These results highlight the importance of considering interior parameters to be able to further constrain the geological evolution of these planets and effectively put atmosphere observations into context."}

An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below ~10^5 K and higher emission measures for T > ~10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres."}

We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time.

We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\\star} \\approx 70\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\\star} > 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment.

We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk.

In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed."}

While such companions are detected around young stellar objects, main-sequence stars, red giants, and compact objects, direct observational evidence of close-in companions around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has remained elusive. Here, we present (sub)millimeter time-domain imaging spectroscopy revealing the Keplerian motion of a close-in companion around the AGB star pi1 Gruis. The companion, slightly more massive than the AGB star, is likely a main-sequence star. Unlike more evolved stars with companions at comparable distances, pi1 Gru's companion follows a circular orbit, suggesting an eccentricity-generating mechanism late- or post-AGB. Our analysis suggests that model-predicted circularization rates may be underestimated. Our results highlight the potential of multi-epoch (sub)millimeter interferometry in detecting the Keplerian motion of close companions to giant stars and open avenues for our understanding of tidal interaction physics and binary evolution."}

Analysing their luminosity-specific number density across galaxies of different morphologies has also shown hints that they may be used as tracers of the age and metallicity of stellar populations. A proper understanding of this relation has been hindered by the fact that simultaneously detecting PNe and accurately measuring stellar properties is extremely difficult using classical narrow-band imaging methods, which cannot detect PNe in the bright centres of galaxies. In this work, we use integral-field spectroscopy to overcome this challenge, analysing the inner regions of a sample of ten early-type galaxies from the Extended Planetary Nebulae Survey (ePN.S) for which archival MUSE data was available. With the Diffuse Emission-Line Filter (DELF) technique, we automate the detection of PNe, and perform spectral fitting on the diffuse light to infer kinematics and stellar population parameters. We compare the PN number density profile and its associated alpha-parameter with multiple properties of the host galaxies. We find that our sample follows the previously observationally constrained correlation with the metallicity of the host galaxy. We find a weak anti-correlation between the alpha-parameter and the FUV excess, highlighting the possible relation between the visibility lifetime of PNe on the spectral energy distribution of their host galaxies, with fewer PNe detected in association with stellar populations characterized by a UV excess."}

Within the realm of deep space exploration, the accuracy of ephemerides is of great importance. Current ephemerides employ a simplified rotation model for Callisto, which this study addresses by proposing a novel dynamical model. This model enhancesthe existing orbital dynamics by integrating Callisto's rotational motions influenced by gravitational torques from the Sun, Jupiter, and other Galilean moons within an inertial frame, capturing the intricate coupling between Callisto's orbital and rotational dynamics. The study establishes a full dynamical model by deriving analytical expressions for this coupling and developing an adjustment model for data fitting using precise orbit determination methods. Furthermore, the influence of tidal effects on Callisto's motion is investigated, considering its multi-layered internal structure. Results demonstrate that the difference between the newly established full model and the model in current ephemerides is on the order of tens of meters. When calculating the impact of different internal structures of Callisto on its orbit, the influence of three-layered and two-layered structures is on the order of meters, suggesting that the development of a high-precision dynamical model requires additional constraints on the internal structure of Callisto. This research provides a novel alternative for a new generation of precise numerical ephemerides for Callisto. Additionally, these findings provide a testing platform for the data from the Tianwen-4 mission."}

This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character."}

We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates."}

We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \\cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $< 10\\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $λ<2\\ μ$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies."}

The aim of this study is to clarify under what conditions the observed features of orbital period ratios of super-Earths can be explained, and to identify what causes the dynamical instability of super-Earths captured into resonant chains. We perform N-body simulations for 100 Myr that follow the formation and orbital evolution of super-Earths originating from a ring of planetary embryos at 1 au from the star. The simulations show that super-Earths undergo inward migration in the disk and are captured into mean-motion resonances with their neighbors. As a result, several resonant pairs form a resonant chain. After disk dispersal, some of these chains become dynamically unstable. In such cases, the final distribution of orbital period ratios and their time evolution can be consistent with recent observations. The instabilities of resonant chains are likely triggered by secular perturbations from embryos that remain on outer orbits beyond 1 au, indicating that not only giant planets but also small embryos can disrupt the resonances among inner super-Earths. We therefore further investigate the secular perturbations from outer embryos using analytic formulas and additional orbital calculations. We discuss the conditions required to excite the eccentricities of inner super-Earths on a timescale of about 100 Myr. These conditions include the need for large eccentricities of the outer embryos, as well as constraints on their masses and semimajor axes."}

The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.\n  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.\n  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends.

A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems."}

While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $α\\sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\\sim$ 32$^\\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\\sim$15$^\\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\\circ$ to 30$^\\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations."}

Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies."}

Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \\geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\\,\\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\\star} \\approx 70\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\\star} > 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \\geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments."}

To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations."}

An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\\pm0.14 R_{\\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($ρ_{\\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($ρ_{\\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\\rm c}=14\\pm3 M_{\\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible."}

We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates."}

Both observations detect dust continuum emission and the ALMA observations detect the 12CO J=3-2 line from the circumstellar disk. We do not detect SiO, a potential indicator of giant collisions, but place a limit on the total SiO mass in the system. Unlike previously observed in the infrared, we do not find evidence for variability at millimeter wavelengths when comparing the ALMA continuum observations from 2024 to the pre-collision SMA observations from 2014. We perform modeling of the CO and continuum visibilities and find that both the CO and dust are marginally spatially resolved and are contained to within 20 au from the central star. The modeling of the CO suggests that the outer regions of the disk are gas rich, although further observations are needed to confirm the total gas mass. The evolutionary state of this system has been debated in the literature, and our observations, while not definitive, are generally consistent with the idea that this disk is similar to an evolved protoplanetary or transition/hybrid disk. This could suggest that collisions in the terrestrial planet zone of HD 166191 are occurring while the disk is in a transitional phase, where the inner few au are depleted of gas. This makes HD 166191 an important object for understanding the transition between protoplanetary and debris disks and the stages at which collisions occur."}

This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\\sim100\\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\\geq 10^8 M_\\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies."}
