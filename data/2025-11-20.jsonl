Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$μ$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$μ$m and 11.3$μ$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$μ$m and 21$μ$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$μ$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions ($Δv_{\\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $Δv_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation."}

The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \\gtrsim 10^{6} \\rm{\\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \\lesssim 10^{4} \\rm{\\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \\approx 10^{6-7} \\rm{\\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\\geq 5\\ \\rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\\simeq 3-4\\ \\rm{kpc}$. For quasar luminosities of $L_{\\rm{AGN}}\\simeq 10^{45-46}\\rm{\\ erg\\ s^{-1}}$, the resulting X-ray luminosity is equivalent to that expected from star formation rates $\\rm{SFR}\\simeq 10-200\\ \\rm{M_\\odot\\ yr^{-1}}$, showing that it could be an important source of soft X-rays in AGN host galaxies.

VST-COSMOS offers a 1 deg^2 survey footprint, a single visit depth of 24.6 mag and 68 r-band visits spanning an eleven-year temporal baseline. Compared to a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, the dwarf AGN population shows an elevated fraction of early-type galaxies but a similar fraction of interacting objects, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in triggering these AGN. Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment. Finally, by combining the true number of galaxies, the detectability of AGN and the measured numbers of variable sources in dwarf and massive (M > 10^10 MSun) galaxies, we estimate the relative frequency of AGN in these two mass regimes. Our results suggest that the incidence of AGN in dwarfs and massive galaxies is similar (within less than a factor of 2 of each other), with some evidence that the AGN fraction increases with stellar mass in the dwarf population."}

This transformation is identifiable by observing galaxy colors and can be seen in the morphological transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies, which creates the morphology-density relation seen when comparing populations in clusters to co-eval field galaxies. However, high-z (z > 2) galaxy morphology studies are hindered by the high angular resolution necessary to characterize morphology. We present a study of HST WFC3 F160W observations of protoclusters from the MAMMOTH survey (BOSS1244 and BOSS1542) at z ~ 2.23 with populations of previously identified HAEs. By measuring the Sersic index of 151 HAEs, we look for the early morphological transformation of star-forming galaxies in these well-studied, large, non-virialized protoclusters, which we believe are precursors of present-day clusters. We find the morphology of the populations of star-forming protocluster galaxies does not differ from the co-eval field. However, we identify a population of clumpy, potentially merging galaxies, which could lead to an increase in the population of early-type galaxies in these structures. Additionally, in BOSS1244, which has two previously identified massive quiescent galaxies including a BCG, we find an abundance of early-type galaxies near both the BCG and two co-eval high-z quasars. Although we find a strong similarity between the morphology of field and protocluster galaxies, the population of early-type star-forming galaxies surrounding the spectroscopically confirmed quiescent BCG in BOSS1244, something not seen in BOSS1542, may point to differences in the evolutionary state of these co-eval protoclusters and be a sign of an early forming cluster core in BOSS1244."}

X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \\simeq 6\\times10^8~\\mathrm{K}$.

The small number of young systems with measured obliquities limits statistical conclusions. Here we determine the sky-projected obliquity ($λ$) of the 3 Myr transiting planet with a misaligned outer protoplanetary disk, TIDYE-1 b (IRAS 04125+2902 b), using the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Our dataset lacks a pre-transit baseline and ingress, complicating a blind RM fit.

Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates.

Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations.

The chemical composition of both stars shows remarkable consistency, confirming their common origin, except for calcium, which is significantly enhanced in the primary.

This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment."}

To measure the MIR extinction, we employ two approaches: modeling the intrinsic-to-observed dust thermal spectrum and assessing the differential extinction between hydrogen recombination lines. Expanding on prior work, we directly model the dust-opacity distribution along the line of sight, and we make available a Python code that provides a flexible tool for deriving intrinsic dust emission spectra. We confirm the spatial variability of extinction across the field, demonstrating that dusty sources--such as IRS~29N--exhibit higher local extinction. Furthermore, we verify the absence of PAH emission features in the Galactic center MIR spectra. Using the two complementary methods, we derive a refined ``best guess'' MIR extinction law for Sgr A* and the surrounding Galactic-center region.

Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere."}

These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs."}

Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\\sim$ 5-25 $μ$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations.

To investigate this, we studied 58 meter wave (20-500 MHz) type II solar radio bursts showing both F and H emissions, observed during the period from 13 June 2010 to 25 December 2024, using data obtained with the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers at different locations and Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS). We examined the intensity ratios of the H ($I_H$) and F ($I_F$) emissions and analyzed their variation with heliographic longitude. We found that 14 out of 19 bursts originating from heliographic longitudes beyond $\\pm75^\\circ$ exhibited an $I_H/I_F$ ratio greater than unity. In contrast, 32 out of 39 bursts originating from longitudes within $\\pm75^\\circ$ showed a intensity ratio less than unity. From these results, we conclude that the relative strength of the F and H emissions can be influenced by refraction due to density gradient in the solar corona, directivity and viewing angle of the bursts."}

A Search for Exomoons", "comment": "Submitted to AAS Journals", "summary": "We present a search for exomoons around the Jupiter-like exoplanet Kepler-167e using a NIRSpec JWST transit. Our 60 hour time series clearly reveals the enormous impact of long-term trends in NIRSpec data, specifically a gradual flux drift occurring over each of six 10 hour exposures. We weighed the evidence for exomoons by comparing a planet-only model with a planet+moon model for a grid of twelve different analysis choices. Our grid was comprised of three different reduction pipelines and four different models for the exposure-long trends - two using linear models and two using Gaussian processes. Seven grid realizations indicate a strong exomoon detection, typically favoring a Roche-skimming orbit roughly 10% the size of the planet. We find that the only likely real astrophysical feature driving these fits is a syzygy-like event occurring almost exactly mid-transit, which is highly ambiguous with a spot-crossing event. Indeed, we show that a spot of the necessary size is compatible with the earlier Kepler data. Ironically, the fact that JWST is so superior to Kepler means that our fits are effectively driven by a single transit - a regime in which exomoons have enormous freedom to explain non-Gaussian behavior. We thus strongly urge the next transit be observed in October 2027 to break these degeneracies. Our pilot study to seek transiting exomoons with JWST reveals the profound impact exposure-long trends exert - a cautionary tale for future analyzes of this data - as well as the need for a deeper understanding of this systematic's cause and modeling best-practices."}

This calls for the development of ultra-sensitive wavefront sensors (WFSs), such as Fourier filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFSs), to be operated at low flux, as well as an increase in the XAO loop frame rate. These sensors, which constitute the baseline for current and future XAO systems, exhibit such a high sensitivity at the expense of a non-linear behaviour that must be properly calibrated and compensated for to deliver the required performance. We aim to validate on-sky a recently proposed method that associates the FFWFS with a focal plane detector, the gain scheduling camera (GSC), to estimate in real time the first-order terms of the sensor non-linearities, known as modal optical gains. We implemented a GSC on the adaptive-optics (AO) bench PAPYRUS to be associated with the existing pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). We compared experimental results to expected results obtained with a high-fidelity numerical twin of the AO system. We validated experimentally the method both in laboratory and on-sky. We demonstrated the capability of the GSC to accurately estimate the optical gains of the PWFS at 100 Hz, corresponding to the current limit in speed imposed by PAPYRUS hardware, but it could be applied at higher frequencies to enable frame-by-frame optical gains tracking. The presented results exhibit good agreement on the optical gains estimation with respect to numerical simulations reproducing the experimental conditions tested. Our experimental results validate the strategy of coupling a FFWFS with a focal-plane camera to master the non-linearities of the sensor. This demonstrates its attractiveness for future XAO application."}

Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies."}

PNe in open clusters (OC) are rare but valuable since their study directly links their properties to those of their progenitors, something that cannot be achieved for field PNe. Here, we report the identification of one more OC-PN association to add to the small sample of, now, five pairs. The physical properties of the host cluster, PN and its central star (CSPN) have been explored using high and intermediate-resolution spectral and deep photometric data. The close agreement of the radial velocities of the PN and host cluster, together with concordance of reddening and distance, show that the PN PHR~J1724-3859 is highly likely to be physically associated with the OC Trumpler~25. Deep photometric data allowed clear identification of the CSPN. We find a CSPN effective temperature of around 250 kK and a nebular kinematic age of 23 kyrs, both at the extreme end, like the other members of this small class. The progenitor and final CSPN masses have been estimated to be 5.12$_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$ $M_\\odot$ and 0.95$\\pm$0.12 $M_\\odot$ respectively. These latest results agree with the emerging trend for our other OC-PNe, falling below, but approximately parallel to, the latest initial-to-final-mass relation estimates derived from cluster white dwarfs and has important implications for stellar evolution models.

Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments."}

Significant Galactic dynamic interactions can leave imprints on the orbital properties of OCs, allowing us to use the present day properties of long-lived OCs to reconstruct the MW's dynamic history. To explore these changes, we identify OC analogs in FIRE-2 simulations of MW-mass galaxies. For this work, we focus on one particular FIRE-2 OC, which we identify as an analog to the old, subsolar, distant, and high Galactic latitude MW OC, Berkeley 20. Our simulated OC resides ~6 kpc from the galactic center and ultimately reaches a height $|Z_{\\mathrm{max}}|>2$ kpc from the galactic disk, similar to Berkeley 20. We trace the simulated cluster's orbital and environmental history, identifying key perturbative episodes, including: (1) an interaction with a gas overdensity in a spiral arm that prompts an outward migration event and (2) a substantial interaction with a Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy-mass satellite that causes significant orbital modification. Our simulated OC shows significant resilience to disruption during both its outward migration and the satellite-driven heating event that causes subsequent inward migration. Ultimately, we find these two key processes -- migration and satellite heating -- are essential to include when assessing OC orbital dynamics in the era of Gaia."}

We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\\sim$28\\,\\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\\lesssim$\\,50\\,\\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2\\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\\sim 0.6$.

A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates."}

This study performs a statistical investigation of PDS at various distances from the Sun between 0.3 and 1 AU by exploiting Solar Orbiter data. We compiled and made publicly available an extensive list of PDSs following a well-established methodology that combines the Multitaper method as well as wavelet analysis to reveal the distribution of PDS radial length scales and how they vary with respect to the radial distance. Our results indicate that PDS advected with the ambient slow solar wind are expanded at a rate of approximately 10%, while PDS detected during fast solar wind segments show compression at a similar rate.

While this holds in a static, axisymmetric potential, it is unknown how strongly the time-varying, non-axisymmetric structure of a real galactic disk drives action drift that inhibits cluster reconstruction. We answer this question using a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like spiral disc galaxy. We show that, while stars experience significant action evolution over $\\lesssim 100$ Myr, they do so in a correlated fashion whereby stars born in close proximity maintain very similar actions for up to 0.5 Gyr. The degree of coherence shows no significant dependence on galactocentric radius, but varies between action components: vertical actions decohere for stars born more than a few hundred parsecs apart (likely due to giant molecular clouds), while radial and azimuthal actions remain correlated on kiloparsec scales (likely influenced by spiral arms). We use our measurements of the rate of action decoherence to develop a probabilistic framework that lets us infer the initial sizes of the star cluster progenitors of present-day stellar streams from their measured action distributions, which we apply to 438 known moving groups. Our results suggest that most of these streams likely originated from compact clusters, but that a significant minority are instead likely to be resonant or dynamically induced structures. This method of classifying streams complements existing methods, optimises the use of expensive spectroscopic abundance measurements, and will be enhanced by the more precise kinematic data that will soon become available from \\textit{Gaia} DR4."}

Application to real overcontact binary data demonstrated that the proposed method is practical for obtaining reliable estimates of the fill-out factor and its associated uncertainties."}

IV. Broad Emission Line Evolution Sequence Among Hα, Mg II, and Hβ", "comment": "Accepted by APJ", "summary": "From a parent catalog of 561 changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) identified by Guo et al. (2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 < z < 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the Hα, H\\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then Hα, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility."}

We identify 97 CL quasars showing significant variability in high-ionization broad emission lines, including 45 turn-on and 52 turn-off events, corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 0.042%. This rate is lower than that found for low-ionization CL quasars, likely due to both selection effects and physical differences in high-ionization lines. Based on the CL quasar sample, we find that CL quasars generally exhibit lower accretion rates compared to typical quasars, with average Eddington ratios of log lambda_Edd approximately -1.14 in the bright state and approximately -1.39 in the dim state, compared to approximately -0.65 for typical quasars. While high-ionization lines in CL quasars follow the Baldwin effect on a population level, some individual sources show inverse Baldwin trends. We also find a positive correlation between the variability of high-ionization lines such as Mg II and C III] and the change in bolometric luminosity. In addition, we estimate a characteristic rest-frame timescale of approximately 3 years for CL transitions, with no significant difference between turn-on and turn-off cases. Taken together, these results support an accretion-driven origin for the CL phenomenon and provide new insights into the variability of high-ionization emission lines."}

Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr.

The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test.

This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind.\n  We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-σ$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy.\n  We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\\geq1$~Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions.\n  We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-σ$ relation even in realistic systems."}

G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2. The SiO emission reveals spatially overlapped blue and red outflow lobes, likely driven by an unresolved young stellar object (YSO) in MM1a. The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores. The SO$_{2}$ emission reveals a clear velocity gradient in MM1a, as well as large velocity dispersion ($\\sim$ 3\\,\\kms) within the inner core of MM1a, which are consistent with rotating structures. We estimated the mass, momentum and energy outflow rate, as well as other outflow parameters. The SiO outflow exhibits a different morphology compared to the $^{12}$CO outflow morphology previously observed in MM1a. The SiO and $^{12}$CO outflows are probably associated with disks of separate cores with one face-on and the other edge-on, pointing to multiplicity of YSOs in MM1a. The properties of MM1a indicate that it is a massive protostar that is actively accreting and undergoing star formation."}

We estimated abundances using full-spectrum fitting, full-index fitting, and line-strength analysis, in combination with different stellar population models. We first tested these techniques on mock spectra and SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs, and then applied them to high-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the M31 bulge obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the GTC. We find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced relative to Fe across the bulge, with typical abundances >0.3~dex. In particular, N and Na show steep central enhancements, reaching ~0.5dex. C, Mg, and Si exhibit intermediate enhancements of [X/Fe]~0.2dex, with C and Mg decreasing toward the center to <~0.1dex; while Ca, and to a lesser extent Ti, closely follow Fe, with [X/Fe]<0.1dex. Applying the same analysis to SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs revealed that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge closely resembles that of the most massive galaxies, except for N, which is significantly more enhanced (by ~0.1dex) in the bulge. For the bulk of the bulge, chemical evolution models assuming high star-formation efficiency and a short gas infall timescale reproduce the overall trends in [Fe/H] and [X/Fe]. In the central region (<~100pc), the high metallicity content of the bulge can be explained by either an IMF flatter than Salpeter at high mass, or a prolonged star formation. Additional processes, such as differential galactic winds, appear necessary to account for the observed decoupling among alpha elements and the strong central N enhancement. Our results support a scenario whereby the bulk of the M31 bulge formed during a fast and intense episode of star formation."}

Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 < z_{phot} < 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns."}

A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates."}
