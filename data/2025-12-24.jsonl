Among the discoveries enabled by SDO is the EUV late-phase (ELP), characterised by a secondary enhancement in warm coronal emission occurring tens of minutes after the main flare. While recent work has demonstrated the relevance of the ELP for space weather, its statistical behaviour and physical origin remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the most comprehensive review of the ELP to date, based on 15 years of Fe XVI observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO (SDO/AIA). From a sample of 5335 isolated flares between 2010 and 2025, we identify and validate 467 ELP events. The overall ELP occurrence rate is 8 percent, with no significant dependence on the solar cycle and only a modest enhancement in the low-to-mid M-class range. The ELP typically exhibits and onset delay of 19 minutes, a peak-to-peak delay of 88 minutes, and a duration of 93 minutes. Strong correlations are found between ELP rise and decay rates (p=0.76), and between flare and ELP impulsivity (p=0.61), while no significant correlation is observed between flare and ELP phases. A Principal Component Analysis revealed three dominant axes of variation, corresponding to a timescale component, an energy-release intensity axis, and a partitioning of energy between the flare and ELP. These results suggest that ELP evolution is governed by both flare loop properties and reconnection-driven energetics, likely modulated by a finite magnetic energy budget, and highlight the importance of SDO's long-term observations for understanding flare evolution and the Sun-Earth connection."}

In the case of magnetized plasma, the shear velocity must exceed the local Alfvén speed for the instability to develop. The KHI produces nonlinear waves that eventually roll up into vortices and contribute to turbulence and dissipation. In the solar atmosphere KHI has been detected in coronal mass ejections (CMEs), jets, and prominences, mainly in the low corona. Only a few studies have reported the KHI in the upper corona, and its vortex development there has not been previously observed. We report the event with large-scale KHI waves observed from $\\sim 6$ to 14~$R_{\\odot}$ on 2024-Feb-16 using SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-A coronagraphs. KHI appeared during the passage of a fast CME and evolved into the nonlinear stage showing evidence of vortices. A closely timed subsequent CME in the same region has further developed the fully nonlinear KHI waves along its flank. We find that the radial speed of the CMEs exceeds the estimated local Alfven speed obtained from in-situ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) magnetic field data at perihelia. We propose that such events are rare because the fast CME created specific conditions favorable for instability growth in its trailing edge, including radial elongation of magnetic-field lines, reduced plasma density, and enhanced velocity and magnetic-field shear along the developing interface. The observed growth rate of KHI wave is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions."}

However, several narrow evolutionary paths of isolated massive binaries towards this goal have recently been identified. Due to the high degree of simplification and assumptions applied in previous modelling of these paths, conclusions remained vague so far. For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10--25$M_\\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources."}

We combine multi-band light curves from 1999 to 2025 with over 30 epochs of optical to near-infrared spectroscopy (0.5-2.5 $μ$m), analyzing variability patterns, color behavior, and emission line diagnostics. We investigate the temporal evolution of accretion and outflow indicators and their correlation with photometric states. The light curve reveals a transition from sporadic early dimming events to a quasi-periodic pattern since 2018, with eleven major dips showing asymmetry and stochastic sub-structure. Color-magnitude diagrams show classic UXor-like blueing during deep minima, while near-infrared and mid-infrared color changes indicate thermal evolution of disk. Spectroscopic analysis reveals persistent hydrogen, Ca II, He I, and forbidden line emission. Accretion diagnostics track photometric variability, and forbidden lines often intensify during dips, implying a physical link between extinction and outflows. Estimated accretion rates range from $\\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ $M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$; the outflow rate and density diagnostics are consistent with disk winds and shock-excited jets. V1180 Cas demonstrates dual-mode variability driven by both variable circumstellar extinction and episodic accretion events. The hybrid UXor/EXor behavior, combined with evolving disk signatures and persistent outflows, suggests a young stellar object undergoing coupled accretion-extinction-outflow evolution. Continued monitoring will be essential to fully resolve the physical processes shaping its variability."}

In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term ``nominal total solar irradiance''. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2)."}

To identify lensed SNe in large imaging datasets, current surveys primarily rely on the {\\it magnification} effect of gravitational lensing -- searching for transients that appear brighter than expected \\cite{c3}. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept study that uses a deep neural network to classify previously detected transients. Instead of relying on magnification, this network aims to identify doubly-imaged SNe with small separations ($<0.6$ arcsec) based on the {\\it distorted shape} of the transient object. This proposed method is most applicable to space-based imaging surveys from wide-field imaging observatories such as the upcoming Roman Space Telescope. To train and test our network, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Due to the extreme rarity of lensed SNe, we cannot train a neural network on actual lensed SN data. Instead, we have used HST imaging data to generate simulated imaging datasets for both training and testing. Our simulations use astrophysical priors to define the separations, relative brightnesses, and colors of each multiply-imaged SN. We have also simulated false positives (image artifacts and unlensed supernovae), which are much more prevalent than true lensed SN. Our deep learning model is trained to identify lensed SNe from a single difference image (i.e., not using multiple epochs). This network achieves a recall score of 99\\% on simulated gravitationally lensed SNe. The network successfully distinguishes between single supernovae (SNe) and those with gravitationally lensed SNe, as well as images with zero SNe, achieving recall scores of 90\\% and 96\\% for single-SNe and zero-SNe images, respectively."}

At large scales, magnetic fields play only a minor dynamical role; however, for sufficiently extended turbulent cascades, the motions transition into the MHD regime at a characteristic scale $l_A$. We introduce a new diagnostic based on the structure functions of the gradient directions, which can be obtained directly from spectroscopic and synchrotron intensity observations. We demonstrate that the new measure robustly recovers the transition scale $l_A$. Building on this result, we propose a generalized expression that replaces the traditional Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method for estimating magnetic field strength in the super-Alfvénic regime, where the DCF approach fails. We further show how the magnetization and magnetic field strength of diffuse media, such as the intracluster medium, can be inferred using synchrotron intensity maps. Our theoretical predictions are validated through numerical simulations."}

Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfvénic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfvénic streams: one fast wind, three Alfvénic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfvénicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfvénic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfvénic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfvénicity relates to the solar source conditions."}

Submitted to A&A; comments are welcome", "summary": "In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \\ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \\ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts."}

Stellar age distributions offer crucial insights into galaxy evolution and star formation, though environmental effects can obscure the intrinsic age patterns. Using the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we investigate the azimuthal age distribution of young stars (<2 Gyr) in a sample of five Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies over the past 5 Gyr. We quantify the age gradients across spiral arms using the mean age offset ($Δτ$) and the non-overlap fraction ($f_{non-overlap}$). We further analyse the impact of mergers and fly-by events on the age gradients. Our results show that Auriga spiral galaxies generally feature younger stars in their leading edges compared to the trailing edges, with a typical $Δτ$ between 30 and 80 Myr. However, gas-rich interactions can disrupt this age offset, resulting in similar age distributions on each side of the spiral arms. In three snapshots, we observe similar mean ages on both sides of spiral arms but differing age distribution broadness, coinciding with satellite interactions crossing the host galaxy's disc plane. Our simulation data suggest that the typical azimuthal age variation recovers within ~600 Myr after galaxy interactions. This work highlights the transient role of environmental interactions in shaping spiral arm age patterns."}

Liang"], "title": "Presence of solar inner F-corona and coronal heating", "comment": null, "summary": "A new source in solar corona scattering photospheric and chromospheric Fraunhofer spectral lines is detected below a height of one solar radius above solar limb, consisting of tenuous and cool neutral atoms and much fewer once ionized ions. It is demonstrated via maps at the sample Fraunhofer lines within the band from 516.38 to 539.89nm, reconstructed from one set of spatially successive raster scanning data. The dataset was obtained from a spectrograph during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, at Oden, Arkansas, USA. It is revealed from these maps that both the scattering and its spatial distribution depend on spectral lines, yielded from different ionization and excitation states of neutral metal atoms and ions. The distributions show asymmetry and feature of diffusion originated from the photosphere and chromosphere. Ratio of the Fraunhofer line depth to the continuum intensity evaluated over the observational band peaks at 0.25$\\%$ and has an average of 0.32$\\%$. More discrete and weaker diffusion of emission counterparts of some Fraunhofer lines are detected simultaneously. These properties are critically different from those owned by that F-corona yielded via dust grain scattering beyond heights of about two and half solar radii. Hence a term 'inner F-corona' is dubbed for the assembly of scattering by this new particle source. It becomes definite now that the solar corona consists of not only free electrons and ions but also much fewer yet non-negligible neutral atoms. It is emphasized that global distributions of the outward neutral atom fluxes and coronal magnetic loops can make the abnormal Cowling resistance the most primary mechanism responsible for the coronal heating, via collisions of the neutral atoms injected with ions in the coronal loops. This likes the heating process in Tokamak with neutral beam injection(NBI)."}

As a transition region, the green valley galaxies can give clues about morphological transformation of galaxies from late- to early-types, and therefore the selection of green valley is of fundamental importance. Aims: In this work, for the first time, we evaluate the selection effects of the most used green valley selection criteria. The aim is to understand how these criteria affect the identification of green valley galaxies, their properties, and their impact on galaxy evolution studies. Methods: Using the SDSS optical and GALEX ultraviolet data at redshift z < 0.1, we selected the eight most commonly used criteria based on colours, specific star formation rate, and star formation rate vs. stellar mass. We then studied the properties of the green valley galaxies (their stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, intrinsic brightness, morphological and\n  pectroscopic types) for each selection criterion. Results: We found that when using different criteria, we select different types of galaxies. UV-optical colour-based criteria tend to select more massive galaxies, with lower star formation rates, with higher fractions of composite and elliptical galaxies, than when using pure optical colours. Our results also show that the colour-based criteria are the most sensitive to galaxy properties, rapidly changing the selection of green valley galaxies. Conclusions: Whenever possible, we suggest avoiding the green valley colour-based selection and using other methods or a combination of several, such as the star formation rate vs. stellar mass or specific star formation rate."}

We present a controlled comparison of machine learning (ML) and SED-fitting methods, assessing their accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Using a sample of COSMOS-like galaxies from the Horizon-AGN simulation as a benchmark with known true masses, we evaluate the Parametric t-SNE (Pt-SNE) algorithm -- trained on noise-injected BC03 models -- against the established SED-fitting code LePhare. Our results demonstrate that Pt-SNE achieves superior accuracy, with a root-mean-square error (sigma_F) of 0.169 dex compared to LePhare's 0.306 dex. Crucially, Pt-SNE exhibits significantly lower bias (0.029 dex) compared to LePhare (0.286 dex). Pt-SNE also shows greater robustness across all stellar mass ranges, particularly for low-mass galaxies (10^9 to 10^10 solar masses), where it reduces errors by 47-53 %. Even when restricted to only six optical bands, Pt-SNE outperforms LePhare using all 26 available photometric bands, underscoring its superior informational efficiency. Computationally, Pt-SNE processes large datasets approximately 3.2 x 10^3 times faster than LePhare. These findings highlight the fundamental advantages of ML methods for stellar mass estimation, demonstrating their potential to deliver more accurate, stable, and scalable measurements for large-scale galaxy surveys."}

The nominal total solar irradiance, ${S}^{\\rm N}_{\\odot}$, while based on a current best estimate with uncertainties, was adopted to be an exact reference value of 1361 W m$^{-2}$ by IAU 2015 Resolution B3, corresponding to ``the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area per unit time at distance 1 au''. In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term ``nominal total solar irradiance''. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2)."}
