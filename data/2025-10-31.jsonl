Here, we perform the image\nstacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest\nand homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results\nreveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band,\nwith a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We\nperform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive\na stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy\nis compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar\nmass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the\nlocal MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the\nexistence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of\nthe host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within\nthe first billion years after the Big Bang."}

Through a\nsimple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with\nstochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism\nfor CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \\rm{km}$\ndiameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \\rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate\nobservable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets.

This new formalism is\nbased on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a\nFokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is\nintegrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this\nmethod, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles\nacting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other\nthrough the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the\nparticle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties\nalong Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with\nonly a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In\nparticular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are\nincluded exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical\nimplementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps\nof the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not\npossible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent\npressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux."}

The polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust offers a\nvaluable tool for probing both the dust and the magnetic field in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM).

We present a new method designed to give access to\nthe LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and\npolarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and\n13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We\ndecomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate\ncontributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the\nmeasured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive\nthe polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred\nthe clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a\n$3~{\\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) =\n(139{\\deg}30',-3{\\deg}16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We\nfound this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly\nhorizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization\nangles measured by Planck.

A prototype with a\ncylindrical active volume (radius 3.7 cm, height 5 cm) was tested at the\nINAF--IAPS calibration facility (Rome, Tor Vergata) to assess sensitivity to\nlow-energy electron directionality. We fully reconstruct electrons in the 10-60\nkeV range, obtain angular resolutions as good as 15{\\deg}, and infer modulation\nfactors up to 0.9. These first results demonstrate robust photoelectron\ntracking at tens of keV with strong modulation, indicating that\nphotoelectric-effect polarimetry can be extended to higher energies.

We present the first multi-epoch\nanalysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the\nproperties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust\ncharacteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a\nglimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure\nthe properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia\nphotometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip\nproperties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and\ntheir optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips\nthat range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In\nalmost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed.\nComparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips\ncan be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed\ngrains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain\ndistributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\\mu m$ and in many cases\nhave almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering\ncomponent. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers,\nbut also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar\ndiscs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust\ngrains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting\nmechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are\ndiscussed."}

Here, we address this key unsolved\nissue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow\ngalaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via\nabundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of\ntheir host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the\nempirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption\nthat galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit\nimposed by the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma_\\star$ relation, as a proxy of\nSMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\\rm BH} -\n\\sigma_\\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched\ngalaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid.\nIn addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling\nrelations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an\n$M_{\\rm BH} - M_\\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift.

We\nbenchmark the method using mock datasets representative of\nhigh-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax\nuncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey.\nTests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and\npolarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective\nbackground-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The\ndependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization\namplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing\npolarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high\nGalactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic\nsolutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating\nits accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both\nmethods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is\nprior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number\nof clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly\napplicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of\nlarge-scale stellar polarization surveys."}

In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key\nindicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular\ngrowth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies,\nand the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic\npower of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for\ndynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group\nclasses defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the\nend of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with\na stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various\ndynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity\ndispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group\nbarycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards\nvirialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that\nfirst-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with\nthe IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population\nthan the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG\nsystems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each\ncontributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps,\nthe difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $\\Delta M4-1$,\nproves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the\nconventional $\\Delta M2-1$ gap.

The outflows show a dust polarization\nof $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at\n$4-6\\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly\npolarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\\sim110^{\\circ}$\nconnecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the\nblue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong\nB-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and\nsupernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent\nkinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of\nmetals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium."}

We measure [Eu/Fe]\nabundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC,\nproviding the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across\nits full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu\nabundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process\nrelative to $\\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows\nenhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values\nmeasured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from\n$\\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia\nsupernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H],\nsignificantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg]\nremains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and\n$\\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity,\nbeginning at [Fe/H] $\\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with\nrespect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H]\n$\\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu\n(with respect to the $\\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with\nwhat observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group.

We use\nthe database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf\ngalaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy,\ninfrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability.\nMulti-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these\nmethods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of\nthese methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active\nby some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy\nproperties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties\nusing statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN\nselected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest\nstar formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key\npopulation differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher\nAGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star\nformation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic\ndiagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to\nthe sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of\naccretion."}

The\nsolver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines\nfollowing the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters\nbased on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the\nviscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation,\nwe performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the\nsound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast\nmagnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and\nwithout the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement\nwith the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok\net al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our\nformulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping\nframework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides\nefficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency.\nFinally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a\ngalaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and\nplasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation\noffers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic\nviscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems."}

By comparing modeled thermal\nprofiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain\nbulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing\na variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional\nthermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its\ntrajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on\nmeasurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid\nbulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and\nconductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth\nthroughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the\nthermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal\nprofiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O,\nCO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the\nmodeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3\nau indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\\sim$150 K can only be\nachieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the\nalbedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2."}

This\nunprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O\n= 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic\ncosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet\nnucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently\nconverts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the\nouter layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are\nconsistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed\nspectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that\ncurrent outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never\nreaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after\nperihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents\na paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal\nGCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their\nprimordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in\nOctober 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this\ninterpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary\npathway for interstellar objects."}

However, the spatial scales over which the initial\nconditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We\nreport the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar\nmagnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass\nstar forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical\ndensity-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial\ndependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The\n$i_{\\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with\nthe typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a\nconnection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from\nthe Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system\nconfigurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\\rm mag}$ distribution\nand suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar\ncores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant\nimplications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should\nexplore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection."}
