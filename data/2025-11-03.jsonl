A leading\nexplanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric\nKozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially\nwide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation\nat periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed\nconfigurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant\ncompanions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to\nreproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis\nstudies often predict that many source \"cold Jupiters\" are destroyed by tidal\ndisruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with\nimproved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by\ntidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular\ndynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach\nto estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new\npopulation synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that\nimproved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor\nof $\\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\\gtrsim 0.5\\%$ around FGK stars)\nconsistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto\nthe star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital\nperiods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results\nsuggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with\nrealistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter\nformation."}

Previously, this feature\nwas attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water\nsnowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the\nspectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes\nin grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80\nau, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both\nfeatures with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk\nmodel that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the\npost-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder\nand the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline:\nthe shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor\nrecondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor\nreservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$\nyr at the disk atmosphere.

The\nionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the\nmechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be\ntoo weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM\nmetallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We\nexploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF)\nand applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N\nUVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also \"deabsorbed\" the\nstrongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM\nsignal.

The TPCF shows a\nclear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but\nwhen deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines\nassociated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\\sigma$,\nalthough 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional\nweak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a\nsignificant CIV peak.

The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous\nand differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy\nprescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\\'e maps is formulated as\neither an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP).

One hypothesis\nis that LM red giants (RGs) engulf more planets than IM RGs, which results in a\nfaster surface rotation and a higher magnetic activity. Indeed, LM stars reach\na maximum radius at the RGB tip that is much larger than for IM stars, making\nthem more likely to engulf planets. However, we need to study the evolution of\nthe active star fraction along the RGB to firmly check this hypothesis. I use\nindependent indicators tracing the activity level in the chromosphere based on\nthe Ca II H&K, Halpha, Mg I and infrared Ca II spectral lines from LAMOST data\nfor about 3000 RGs whose evolutionary stage has been identified by\nasteroseismology with the Kepler mission. I find that the fraction of active\nstars decreases for IM stars along the RGB but unexpectedly increases for LM\nstars. Such an increase is not explained by models of single-star evolution and\nis consistent with the fact that LM stars are more susceptible than IM stars of\nengulfing planets. Indeed, data shows that IM main-sequence stars exhibit a\ndearth of planets, consistently with predictions from planet formation theory.\nI also observe that the fraction of active stars tends to increase for both LM\nand IM stars on the HB, in partial contrast with previous findings. Finally, I\ndiscover that the IM RGB star KIC 9780154 may have engulfed one or more\nplanet(s) as its surface rotation from photometry is twice faster than its\nenvelope rotation from asteroseismology.

Stacking will be\nparticularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of\nthe same planet are time-consuming.

For two\ndominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately\nreflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across\nplanets.

Inner CGM\nenergetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and\nvelocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal\nsupersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent\nstratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is\nregulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as\nin more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to\nqualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high\nspecific energy material ($\\gg v^2_{\\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such\n`turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted\nwide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV\nabsorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\\sim L^\\star$ and\nlower-mass halos."}

Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by\nperforming all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction\ndirectly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two\ncomplementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel\nlinked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude\nspeedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent\nhalo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through\ndiscrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological\noptimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a\nREINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo\nconnectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with\ndiscrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for\ndifferentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of\nstructure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We\nmake our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/."}

Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803\nred-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler\nMission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a\nk-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios\npredict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of\nstars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances\ndo not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these\nstars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are\nmass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age\n(higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor\ncandidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than\nthe asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise\ncontrol samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2)\nasteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight\ndifferences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the\nmass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic\ndifferences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar\nabundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377\nmass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly\nsuggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and\nsupports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary\nmass transfer."}
