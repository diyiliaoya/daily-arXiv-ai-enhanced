Extending prior methodological work, this study\ninvestigates the potential of an unsupervised learning approach to scale\neffectively to larger stellar populations, including objects in crowded fields,\nand without the need for pre-selected catalogues, specifically focusing on 13\n405 sources selected from Gaia DR3 and lying in the selected region of the CMD.\nOur methodology incorporates unsupervised clustering techniques based primarily\non statistical features extracted from Gaia DR3 epoch photometry. We used the\nt-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to identify\nvariability classes, their subtypes, and spurious variability induced by\ninstrumental effects. The clustering results revealed distinct groups,\nincluding hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables (CVs), eclipsing binaries, and\nobjects in crowded fields, such as those in the Andromeda (M31) field. Several\npotential stellar subtypes also emerged within these clusters. Notably, objects\npreviously labelled as RR Lyrae were found in an unexpected region of the CMD,\npotentially due to either unreliable astrometric measurements (e.g., due to\nbinarity) or alternative evolutionary pathways. This study emphasises the\nrobustness of the proposed method in finding variable objects in a large region\nof the Gaia CMD, including variable hot subdwarfs and CVs, while demonstrating\nits efficiency in detecting variability in extended stellar populations. The\nproposed unsupervised learning framework demonstrates scalability to large\ndatasets and yields promising results in identifying stellar subclasses."}

Two initial configurations are considered, an\n$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either\nan extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form\nKuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk\ninteractions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar\nencounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with\nejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud.

In anomaly\ndetection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data\npoints. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,\nuser-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for\nthe complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we\nintroduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly\nDetection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find\nnovelties.\n  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different\ngeometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance\nmetrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score\nthat is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this\nmulti-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery\non astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.\nRubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the\nZwicky Transient Facility.\n  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --\nanomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other\nstate-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes\ndiscovered.

We confirm 46 as genuine HADS variables,\nwith 40 stars having their dominant frequencies identified for the first time.\nAmong them, 7 pulsate solely in the fundamental mode; 21 exhibit the\nfundamental mode alongside at least one low-amplitude nonradial mode; 5 are\npure double-mode pulsators (the fundamental and first-overtone modes), 13 show\ndouble-mode pulsations accompanied by additional low-amplitude nonradial modes.\nThe remaining four stars are classified as other types of variables: two (TIC\n69546708 and TIC 110937533) are confirmed hot subdwarfs, one (TIC 8765832) is a\ncataclysmic variable, and one (TIC 32302937) is a likely hot subluminous star,\nbut it requires further spectroscopic confirmation. We investigate the\nperiod-luminosity (PL) relation, also known as the Leavitt law, for these 46\nconfirmed HADS stars, deriving a revised relation: $M_{V}= (-3.31\n\\pm0.39)~\\mathrm{log}~P+(-1.68 \\pm 0.39)$. This result is consistent with\nprevious studies. Their distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nindicates that HADS stars are not strictly confined to be within a narrow\ninstability strip previously found, but can extend beyond it, with a\ndistribution toward lower temperatures. The refined classifications presented\nhere establish a high-quality sample for precise asteroseismic modelling and\nenhance the potential for future machine-learning-assisted searches and\nclassifications of HADS stars in large-scale photometric surveys."}

This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures.

We reveal that in environments with higher external\ndensity, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion\nas the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially\nincreases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that\nappear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also\ninfluences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with\nthe high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes\nsmaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a\nlong duration.

While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays\nincreases mass loss rates ($\\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\\dot{M}$, and the net\nresult for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster,\nand more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g.,\n13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere\nresulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for\nall but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity\natmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b,\n$R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass\nloss rate, $\\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation.\nHowever, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and\nsuper-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be >>$R_P$, making it necessary to use\n$\\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss\nrates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative\ncooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\\dot{M}$."}

We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on\none such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z =\n2.3908\\pm0.0003$, is associated with a Damped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at\nnearly the same redshift $2.4007\\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column\ndensity of $\\log N(\\mathrm{H\\,I}) = 21.214 \\pm 0.003$. The DLA is very\nmetal-rich (close to the Solar metallicity after correction for depletion on\ndust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the\nmass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs.\nSurprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has\nstrong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived\nkinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV\nradiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in\nclose proximity, i.e. part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in\nthe same overdensity of galaxies. We use the line ratios of the CI\nfine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\\rm\nH} \\sim 10^{3}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.

Several studies have explored LNSS architecture\nusing geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing\nLNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using\nanalytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south\npole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)\nand lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with\nEarth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not\nbeen adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary\nmulti-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar\norbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation\nperformance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous\nstation-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS\nintegration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse\nset of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV\nrequirements.

In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium\n(ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal\nparticles and produce $\\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser\ngas, they produce more $\\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different\ncosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity of a\nturbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two\nquantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the\ncorrelation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must\nescape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\\gamma$-ray emission and be\nconsistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms\n(either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of\nmagnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps)\nis necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the\nsignificant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray\nreacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent\nreacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds\ndrive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray luminosity."}

Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that\ncometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of\nplanet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the\narchitecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments."}

We predict the detection of $33 \\pm 9$ young\ntransiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29\n\\pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves\nsensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf\ndetections are well-sampled within two weeks.

This approach directly detects,\nclassifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing\ntraditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both\ncompact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded\nfields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy)\nand discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins),\nshowcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing.\nOur framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial\nfeatures holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection\nprecision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned\nredshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a\nparadigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification,\nand preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will\nconcentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from\nraw spectral traces."}

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (referee\n  stage: minor revisions)", "summary": "Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks\nmay undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late\ninfall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for\na disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find\nconsiderable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which\nmay act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas\nsurrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which\nplanets form."}
