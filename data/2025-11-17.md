### [1] [An Analytical Model for the Eccentricity Cascade: Hot Jupiter Formation via S-type Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10726)
*Eritas Yang,Yubo Su*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文通过分析偏心级联机制，阐明了热木星形成的动力学过程，证明了在存在中间扰动体的情况下，可以避免传统von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai机制所需的精细调谐，为热木星形成提供了一种稳健的迁移通道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高偏心率迁移机制需要行星初始轨道与外部伴星轨道近乎垂直的精细调谐条件，本研究旨在探索如何通过偏心级联机制规避这种限制，为热木星形成提供更普遍适用的理论框架。

Method: 通过解析方法表征控制偏心级联的动力学特性，推导S型不稳定性的解析判据，获得描述EC起始的闭式表达式，并界定其有效运行的参数空间。

Result: 研究发现：原热木星偏心率在最接近动力学不稳定状态时被最有效地激发；添加遥远第四体使得这种不稳定可以逐渐接近；不稳定机制与双星系统中S型行星的稳定性密切相关。

Conclusion: 偏心级联机制在广泛的中间扰动体参数范围内都能有效运行，表明其作为热木星迁移通道具有强大的鲁棒性和普遍适用性。

Abstract: A widely explored pathway for hot Jupiter (HJ) formation is high-eccentricity migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by an exterior companion. However, for a distant or low-mass companion, this mechanism typically demands that the planet's initial orbit be very nearly perpendicular to that of the companion. In previous work (Yang et al. 2025), we demonstrated that such fine-tuning can be circumvented in the HAT-P-7 system due to the presence of an intermediate body that efficiently couples the orbits of the planet and the distant companion -- a mechanism we termed the eccentricity cascade (EC). In this work, we analytically characterize the dynamics governing the EC and delineate the parameter space within which it effectively operates. Our qualitative results are as follows: (i) The proto-HJ's eccentricity is most efficiently excited when the inner triple is on the verge of dynamical instability, (ii) the addition of a distant fourth body allows this instability to be approached gradually, and (iii) the instability mechanism is closely related to the stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets in binaries. By deriving an analytic criterion for S-type instability, we obtain closed-form expressions describing the onset of the EC. Our results show that efficient HJ formation via the EC occurs across a broad range of intermediate perturbers, highlighting its potential as a robust migration channel.

TL;DR: 本文验证了TOI-6448 b这颗年轻行星的存在，它是一个8.8±0.8地球半径的行星，轨道周期14.8天，位于34±3百万年年轻的Vela Population IV星团中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现年轻（<50 Myr）、近距离（<30天周期）行星对于理解开普勒望远镜发现的成熟行星分布的形成机制至关重要，但目前样本量仍然太小，无法进行稳健的统计比较。

Method: 确认TOI-6448恒星在Vela Population IV星团的成员身份，并使用等时线、变星性和陀螺年代学重新推导星团年龄。

Result: 验证了TOI-6448 b行星的存在，其半径为8.8±0.8地球半径，轨道周期14.8天，年龄为34±3百万年。与其他年轻行星一样，它位于参数空间中很少有较老行星的区域。

Conclusion: 这一发现支持了先前关于年轻恒星周围5-11地球半径行星数量异常多的发现，这不能仅用年轻恒星观测灵敏度降低来解释。预计在Vela、金牛-御夫座、天蝎-半人马座和猎户座等区域的持续搜索将揭示数十个<50 Myr的凌星行星。

Abstract: The discovery of infant (< 50 Myr), close-in (<30-day period) planets is vital in understanding the formation mechanisms that lead to the distribution of mature transiting planets as discovered by Kepler. Despite several discoveries in this age bin, the sample is still too small for a robust statistical comparison to older planets. Here we report the validation of TOI-6448 b, an 8.8 +/- 0.8 Re planet on a 14.8 day orbit. TOI-6448 was previously identified to be a likely member of Vela Population IV. We confirm the star's membership and re-derive the age of the cluster using isochrones, variability, and gyrochronology. We find the star, and thus planet, to be 34 +/- 3 Myr. Like other young planets, TOI-6448 b lands in a region of parameter space with few older planets. While just one data point, this fits with prior findings of an excess of 5-11Re planets around young stars far beyond what can be explained by reduced sensitivity at young ages. Our ongoing search of Vela, Taurus-Auriga, Sco-Cen, and Orion are expected to reveal dozens more < 50 Myr transiting planets.

### [3] [Indirect forces in disc-planet interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10745)
*Roman R. Rafikov,Nicolas P. Cimerman,Callum W. Fairbairn,Alexander J. Dittmann*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文研究了原行星盘与嵌入行星之间引力耦合中的间接力影响，分析了忽略间接力对盘密度扰动模式、行星施加于盘的力矩以及盘施加于行星力矩的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究间接力在盘-行星引力耦合中的重要性，因为恒星反射运动导致的非惯性参考系会产生间接力，这些力在行星盘系统中经常被忽略。

Method: 使用分析和数值方法，比较包含和不包含间接力情况下盘密度扰动的空间模式、行星对盘的力矩计算以及盘对行星的力矩。

Result: 对于低质量行星，线性状态下只有m=1方位角谐波的扰动模式受影响，振幅随距离增加；行星力矩和沉积力矩密度受影响较小。对于高质量行星，更多方位角谐波受影响，间接力对行星力矩和II型迁移有更强影响。

Conclusion: 间接力在盘-行星耦合中具有重要影响，特别是在计算盘力矩时应包含行星间接力以确保角动量守恒，相应的间接力矩具有振荡性和径向发散特性。

Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.

### [4] [Hydrogen-line profiles from accreting gas giants and their CPDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10751)
*Gabriel-Dominique Marleau,Thomas Henning,Roy van Boekel,Myriam Benisty,Yuhiko Aoyama,Inga Kamp*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用ELT/METIS高分辨率光谱仪观测吸积气体巨行星的可行性，重点关注氢复合线（特别是Brackett alpha和Pfund系列线）作为行星形成示踪剂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前观测到的处于吸积阶段的气体巨行星很少，ELT仪器具有更高的灵敏度和更小的内工作角，能够进行详细表征。研究旨在评估METIS观测吸积行星的能力。

Method: 结合半解析多维流描述吸积行星及其环行星盘的流动，与局部NLTE激波发射计算相结合，生成高分辨率谱线轮廓。以PDS 70 b为基准案例，考虑无消光和可忽略磁层吸积贡献的极限情况。

Result: 当PDS 70 b吸积强度最大时，Brα线峰值等于光球连续谱。在Brα波段，仅PDS 70 b的连续谱在4小时内SNR=12，对于基准吸积率，线峰值在4小时内每bin SNR=28。峰值超出仅需约10分钟即可达到SNR=3。

Conclusion: Brα是ELT/METIS在短积分时间内可访问的有效行星形成示踪剂。解析的谱线轮廓将为吸积行星的质量和半径提供独立约束，并帮助识别起作用的吸积机制。

Abstract: Few gas giants have been observed in their accretion phase. ELT instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, allowing detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph with a resolution R = 1e5. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible to METIS, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local NLTE shock-emission calculations. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction, appropriate for gas giants in gaps, and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion. We use resolved photospheric models, and include detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. When the accretion onto PDS 70 b is at its maximum observed strength, the Br a line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum, which is modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, making the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already only the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR = 12 in 4 h, and for the fiducial accretion rate, the line peak will have a per-bin SNR = 28 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 10 min to reach SNR = 3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to ELT/METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of accreting planets, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.

### [5] [Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782)
*Milagros Colazo,Alvaro Alvarez-Candal*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究结合多个巡天数据对海王星外天体进行光度测量，建立了包含43,878个测量值的大型数据库，分析了相位角对颜色的影响，并首次展示了鲁宾天文台的观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过整合SDSS、Col-OSSOS、DES和鲁宾天文台等数据集，构建更全面的海王星外天体光度数据库，研究相位角对颜色的影响，并验证鲁宾天文台的观测能力。

Method: 结合SDSS、Col-OSSOS、DES和鲁宾First Look数据，使用u、g、r、i、z和J滤光片进行光度测量，计算绝对颜色测量值和光谱斜率差异，进行统计分析。

Result: 获得了43,878个测量值和8,738条相位曲线，发现颜色与轨道参数无强相关性，相位角校正很重要。鲁宾天文台首次观测填补了参数空间的空白区域，确认了TNO颜色随相位角变化的红化和蓝化趋势。

Conclusion: 研究建立了大规模TNO光度数据库，证实了相位角对颜色的重要影响，展示了鲁宾天文台在发现和表征暗弱天体方面的巨大潜力，为未来完整巡天提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.
  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.
  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.
  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.

### [6] [What's Inside Matters: The Effect of Oxygen Fugacity and Initial Volatile Abundance on the Atmospheres of the TRAPPIST-1 Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10801)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个改进的大气-内部交换模型，用于研究TRAPPIST-1行星的地质演化，重点关注碳循环、氧逸度和水含量对大气成分的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRAPPIST-1行星是研究M矮星周围行星大气和地球物理性质的重要目标。为了有效识别其大气成分，需要首先理解它们的地质演化过程。

Method: 扩展现有的大气-内部交换模型，加入碳循环、表面温度计算、氧逸度作为内部参数、氧化反应和扩散限制逃逸计算，追踪CO₂、CO、H₂O和H₂在四个行星储层中的分布。

Result: 模型成功验证于地球，应用于TRAPPIST-1 d、e和f行星。结果显示氧逸度显著影响所有三个行星的H₂和CO₂分压，对其中两个行星的CO有较小影响。H₂强烈依赖于水质量分数，大气过程的加入显著改变了当前H₂和CO的丰度。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了考虑内部参数对于进一步约束这些行星地质演化的重要性，并为大气观测提供了重要背景。

Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 planets have become prime targets for studying the atmospheric and geophysical properties of planets around M-dwarf stars. To effectively identify their atmospheric composition, we first must understand their geological evolution. For this study, we focus on enhancing an existing atmosphere-interior exchange model by incorporating additional geological processes relevant to rocky planets. We have extended the model to include the carbon cycle, which enables the model to track four key gas species - CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, and H$_2$ - across four planetary reservoirs: the mantle, plate, ocean, and atmosphere. Major features added include surface temperature calculations which are crucial for the carbon cycle, oxygen fugacity as a planetary interior parameter in the model, and oxidation reactions and diffusion-limited escape calculations to the atmosphere portion of the model. We successfully validated the model for Earth and applied this model to study the effect of oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance on TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f. Our results for present-day abundances show that oxygen fugacity significantly affects the partial pressures of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ for all three planets with minor effects for CO on two of the planets. We also found that H$_2$ is strongly dependent on water mass fraction (WMF). The addition of atmospheric processes produced a significant difference in the H$_2$ and CO abundances at present-day. These results highlight the importance of considering interior parameters to be able to further constrain the geological evolution of these planets and effectively put atmosphere observations into context.

TL;DR: 本研究使用ALMA高分辨率观测数据分析了HD 163296原行星盘的化学组成，通过DRive检索代码和PEGASIS化学模型约束了C/O比约为1.1，发现了DCO+的三环结构，并首次获得了NH2CHO和HNCO的严格上限值。

Motivation: 原行星盘的物理化学条件决定了其化学组成，这些组成随后会被形成的行星继承。通过高分辨率分子线观测和建模来探测这些条件至关重要。

Method: 使用ALMA在Bands 3、4、6和7的高分辨率观测数据，结合DRive检索代码分析分子柱密度和激发温度分布，利用PEGASIS天体化学代码模拟盘化学，通过多种分子观测约束C/O比。

Result: 获得最佳拟合C/O比为1.1，呈现了迄今最高分辨率的DCO+发射图显示三环化学亚结构，首次获得NH2CHO和HNCO的严格上限值（分别<7e11 cm-2和<1e11 cm-2）。

Conclusion: NH2CHO和HNCO主要在盘内尘埃表面形成，但物理化学脱附机制效率低，难以达到可探测的气相丰度，但仍是未来ALMA观测的有希望目标。

Abstract: The physical and chemical conditions within a protoplanetary disk play a crucial role in determining its chemical composition, which is subsequently inherited by any forming planets. To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations.

TL;DR: 本研究针对中国天问四号木星探测任务，提出了卡利斯托卫星的新动力学模型，通过整合轨道和旋转动力学耦合效应，提高了轨道精度，为新一代精密星历表提供基础。


<details>

Conclusion: 该研究为卡利斯托新一代精密数值星历表提供了新方案，同时为天问四号任务数据验证提供了测试平台。

Abstract: China is planing to launch the Tianwen-4 mission around the year 2030, with its aim being the exploration of Jupiter and its moon, Callisto. Within the realm of deep space exploration, the accuracy of ephemerides is of great importance. Current ephemerides employ a simplified rotation model for Callisto, which this study addresses by proposing a novel dynamical model. This model enhancesthe existing orbital dynamics by integrating Callisto's rotational motions influenced by gravitational torques from the Sun, Jupiter, and other Galilean moons within an inertial frame, capturing the intricate coupling between Callisto's orbital and rotational dynamics. The study establishes a full dynamical model by deriving analytical expressions for this coupling and developing an adjustment model for data fitting using precise orbit determination methods. Furthermore, the influence of tidal effects on Callisto's motion is investigated, considering its multi-layered internal structure. Results demonstrate that the difference between the newly established full model and the model in current ephemerides is on the order of tens of meters. When calculating the impact of different internal structures of Callisto on its orbit, the influence of three-layered and two-layered structures is on the order of meters, suggesting that the development of a high-precision dynamical model requires additional constraints on the internal structure of Callisto. This research provides a novel alternative for a new generation of precise numerical ephemerides for Callisto. Additionally, these findings provide a testing platform for the data from the Tianwen-4 mission.

TL;DR: 本研究通过N体模拟探讨了超级地球系统中轨道周期比分布的特征及其时间演化，揭示了共振链不稳定的机制主要是由外轨道胚胎的长期摄动引起的。

Motivation: 解释观测到的超级地球系统相邻行星轨道周期比分布特征及其时间变化，识别导致共振链动力学不稳定的条件。

Method: 进行100 Myr的N体模拟，追踪从1 au处行星胚胎环形成的超级地球的形成和轨道演化，包括向内迁移和共振捕获过程。

Result: 模拟显示超级地球在盘中向内迁移并被捕获到平均运动共振中形成共振链，盘消散后部分共振链变得不稳定，最终轨道周期比分布与观测一致。

Conclusion: 共振链的不稳定性主要由外轨道胚胎的长期摄动触发，需要外胚胎具有较大偏心率和特定质量、半长轴条件才能在约100 Myr时间尺度上激发内超级地球的偏心率。

Abstract: Recent observations have revealed the distribution of orbital period ratios of adjacent planets in multiple super-Earth systems and how these distributions change with time. The aim of this study is to clarify under what conditions the observed features of orbital period ratios of super-Earths can be explained, and to identify what causes the dynamical instability of super-Earths captured into resonant chains. We perform N-body simulations for 100 Myr that follow the formation and orbital evolution of super-Earths originating from a ring of planetary embryos at 1 au from the star. The simulations show that super-Earths undergo inward migration in the disk and are captured into mean-motion resonances with their neighbors. As a result, several resonant pairs form a resonant chain. After disk dispersal, some of these chains become dynamically unstable. In such cases, the final distribution of orbital period ratios and their time evolution can be consistent with recent observations. The instabilities of resonant chains are likely triggered by secular perturbations from embryos that remain on outer orbits beyond 1 au, indicating that not only giant planets but also small embryos can disrupt the resonances among inner super-Earths. We therefore further investigate the secular perturbations from outer embryos using analytic formulas and additional orbital calculations. We discuss the conditions required to excite the eccentricities of inner super-Earths on a timescale of about 100 Myr. These conditions include the need for large eccentricities of the outer embryos, as well as constraints on their masses and semimajor axes.

TL;DR: 行星形成模拟预测行星系统在盘阶段形成密集的共振链，但观测显示大多数成熟系统是非共振的。研究发现，原始共振链在数亿年内发生动力学不稳定性，导致共振破坏，这与观测到的共振比例随恒星年龄下降的现象一致。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么行星形成模拟预测的共振链系统与观测到的非共振成熟系统之间存在差异，并验证动力学不稳定性机制能否解释这种转变。

Method: 构建简化模型，包含I型迁移、胚胎生长和N体积分（持续到500 Myr），生成合成行星群，分析共振破坏的时间尺度。

Result: 几乎所有系统在盘阶段处于共振状态，但随后缓慢扩散，动力学不稳定性在数十到数百Myr内发生，特别是当系统形成于具有汇聚迁移陷阱的盘中时。

Conclusion: 模型与观测数据高度一致，表明共振链的动力学不稳定性是解释成熟系统非共振特征的关键机制，早期演化模拟与Gyr年龄系统的比较存在偏差。

Abstract: Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究通过3D辐射流体动力学模拟分析了原行星盘中由倾斜内盘投射的阴影对盘动力学的影响，发现30°倾斜阴影比极向阴影产生更强的吸积效应，并导致外盘翘曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然近红外和亚毫米图像中经常观测到原行星盘中的阴影，但之前只研究了对称于中平面的情况（如极向对齐内盘）。本研究旨在探索倾斜内盘投射的阴影对盘动力学的影响。

Method: 使用3D辐射流体动力学模拟，研究由30°相互倾角内盘投射的阴影效应，并与局部等温模拟进行比较验证。

Result: 30°倾斜阴影导致更强的吸积（α∼1），盘在方位角上被挤压两次，产生激波和强径向流。外盘形成翘曲：内盘区域向阴影对齐倾斜，而外盘以不同方向倾斜和扭曲，相对内区域倾斜约32°。

Conclusion: 阴影会导致盘翘曲，而不仅仅是翘曲的结果。m=1,n=1温度扰动通过发射弯曲波驱动翘曲，该模式在3°至30°相互倾角范围内都有显著贡献，在约15°时达到峰值。

Abstract: Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $α\sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.

*Thomas Meier,Douglas Potter,Christian Reinhardt,Joachim Stadel*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: pkdgrav3是一个高性能、完全并行的树-SPH代码，用于大规模流体动力学模拟，包括自引力。它结合了高效的层次树算法和现代SPH实现，优化用于大规模并行混合CPU/GPU架构，在数千个CPU核心和GPU上高效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在大规模并行混合CPU/GPU架构上高效运行的高性能流体动力学模拟代码，用于天体物理和行星应用，特别是行星尺度碰撞等高度动态的自引力系统。

Method: 结合高效的层次树算法进行引力和邻居查找，以及现代平滑粒子流体动力学(SPH)实现，采用混合共享/分布式内存模型和异步通信方案。

Result: 通过标准测试验证了数值精度，与解析或参考解表现出良好一致性。已在多个同行评审出版物中成功应用于行星尺度碰撞建模，准确追踪材料起源和热力学演化。

Conclusion: pkdgrav3提供了一个强大、灵活且可扩展的平台，能够充分利用现代异构高性能计算系统的潜力，适用于天体物理和行星应用。

Abstract: We present pkdgrav3, a high-performance, fully parallel tree-SPH code designed for large-scale hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity. Building upon the long development history of pkdgrav, the code combines an efficient hierarchical tree algorithm for gravity and neighbor finding with a modern implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) optimized for massively parallel hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. Its hybrid shared/distributed memory model, combined with an asynchronous communication scheme, allows pkdgrav3 to scale efficiently to thousands of CPU cores and GPUs. We validate the numerical accuracy of pkdgrav3 using a suite of standard tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with analytic or reference solutions. The code was already used in several peer-reviewed publications to model planetary-scale impacts, where SPH's Lagrangian nature allows accurate tracking of material origin and thermodynamic evolution. These examples highlight pkdgrav3's robustness and efficiency in simulating highly dynamical, self-gravitating systems. pkdgrav3 thus provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable platform for astrophysical and planetary applications, capable of exploiting the full potential of modern heterogeneous high-performance computing systems.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 确认TOI-1422系统中存在第二颗凌星行星TOI-1422 c，这是一个亚海王星，轨道周期34.563天。该系统是一个罕见的反序系统，外行星比内行星更致密。检测到内行星的凌星时间变化，表明存在持续动力学相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前在径向速度数据中检测到约29天的残余信号和可能的单次凌星事件，但不确定这两个信号是否属于同一伴星。需要确认系统中是否存在第二颗行星。

Method: 结合TESS的三个凌星观测（包括两个新可用扇区）以及新的和存档的径向速度测量数据。进行动力学分析，结合凌星时间变化和径向速度数据。

Result: 确认了第二颗凌星行星TOI-1422 c，半径为2.61±0.14地球半径，质量为14±3地球质量，轨道周期34.563天。内行星TOI-1422 b的凌星时间变化幅度达5小时。发现这是一个罕见的反序系统，外行星比内行星更致密。

Conclusion: 行星c本身可能不足以解释观测到的全部凌星时间变化幅度，推测系统中可能存在第三颗未被探测到的低质量行星，位于两个已知轨道之间。

Abstract: TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\oplus}$ and $4R_{\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\pm0.14 R_{\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($ρ_{\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($ρ_{\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\rm c}=14\pm3 M_{\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.

Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a cryogenically cooled 1.8-m space telescope designed to address fundamental questions about the evolution of galactic ecosystems, the origins of planetary atmospheres, and the buildup of dust and metals over cosmic time. PRIMA will achieve unprecedented sensitivity in the 24 - 261 $μ$m wavelength range, enabled by background-limited kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) cooled to 120 mK. For PRIMA's Far-InfraRed Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) instrument, we have developed monolithic kilopixel silicon lenslet arrays to efficiently couple incident radiation from the telescope's fore-optics onto the KID absorber elements. These three-dimensional lenslet arrays are fabricated using grayscale lithography, followed by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and are anti-reflection (AR) coated with a quarter-wavelength thick deposition of Parylene-C. The lenslet arrays are aligned and bonded to the KID arrays using a thin layer of epoxy through a flip-chip bonder. In this work, we report on the optimized fabrication, lens design, AR coating, and bonding processes developed for the FIRESS lenslet arrays. We characterize brassboard lenslet arrays fabricated to meet the specifications of the FIRESS low and high spectral bands, demonstrate stepped-thickness AR-coatings to achieve high efficiency across broad wavelength ranges, and present spectral transmission measurements of the AR coating and the epoxy bonding layers.

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.

Conclusion: 方差成像方法在EMU全巡天和未来SKA射电连续谱巡天中具有强大的脉冲星探测潜力。

Abstract: It has been proposed that radio pulsars can be distinguished from other point-like radio sources in continuum images by their unique interstellar scintillation signatures. Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

Abstract: Small solar system bodies are becoming increasingly important as missions like NASA's OSIRIS-REx show. However, the study of the characteristics and behavior of these objects on Earth is a challenge as the simulation of their environmental conditions is difficult. We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS ("Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity") project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed.

Abstract: We present the KOALA database, a new set of LTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres calculated with the code ATLAS9, together with the corresponding Opacity Distribution Functions and emergent fluxes. The latter were used also to calculated G-band bolometric corrections and theoretical magnitudes and colours for several photometric systems, i.e. UBVRI, 2MASS, Hypparcos-Tycho, SDSS, Galex, Euclid and Gaia DR3. With respect to the previous grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we adopted the solar mixture by Caffau/Lodders and we extend the sampling in metallicity (from -5.0 to -2.5 dex with step of 0.5 dex, and from -2.5 dex to +0.5 dex with step of 0.25 dex) and in [alfa/Fe] (from -0.4 to +0.4 dex with a step of 0.2 dex). Also, we provide a finer sampling in Teff for Teff lower than 7000 K. This finer grid allows for more accurate interpolation of colours and in many cases it makes not necessary to compute a new model atmosphere, since one of the grid can be used directly. A total of 51663 model atmospheres and emergent fluxes have been computed. Finally, we discuss the impact of [M/H] and [alfa/Fe] on the thermal and pressure structures of the model atmospheres and on theoretical colours.

Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.

Abstract: The plasma of the solar corona harbors a multitude of coronal wave modes, some of which could be dissipated to provide the required energy and momentum to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. We present observations of the corona acquired with the newly commissioned infrared slit spectropolarimeter Cryo-NIRSP at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), Haleakala, Hawaii to study the high frequency wave behavior in closed, active-region structures. Cryo-NIRSP observes the corona off the limb in the Fe XIII 1074 and 1079 nm forbidden atomic lines. The large aperture of DKIST allows us to explore the active region corona with temporal resolution faster than a second with an achieved spatial resolution of 2-5 arcseconds. Enhanced wave power is observed in the power spectra up to 100 mHz. Furthermore, we report on a statistically significant anti-correlation between the Fe XIII 1074 nm peak line intensity and line width in our data, possibly pointing to the presence of compressive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes. These observations show how the powerful spectropolarimetric capabilities of DKIST offer great promise for furthering our knowledge of coronal MHD waves.

Result: 在两个事件中发现了统计显著性约6σ的3.1-3.2 mHz峰值，表现为持续约35分钟的大振幅球形偏振阿尔芬波列。

Conclusion: 研究证实了全球太阳振荡能够到达并可能影响太阳风，为理解太阳振荡在日冕和太阳风中的传播提供了直接观测证据。

Abstract: The Sun's surface vibrates in characteristic 5-minute oscillations, known as p-modes, generated by sound waves trapped within the convection zone. Although these oscillations have long been hypothesized to reach into the solar wind, direct in situ evidence has remained elusive, even during previous close encounters by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Here, we present the first promising in situ detection of 5-minute oscillations in the upper solar corona, based on observations from PSP's three closest perihelia. In two events at 9.9 solar radii, we identify statistically significant ($\sim$ 6 $σ$) 3.1-3.2 mHz peaks in the magnetic field power spectrum, each appearing as a large-amplitude, spherically polarized Alfvénic wave train lasting approximately 35 minutes. These results demonstrate that global solar oscillations can reach and potentially influence the solar wind.

Conclusion: SPICE填补了现有工具在处理复杂恒星表面结构方面的空白，为时域光谱测光巡天提供了强大的建模能力。

Abstract: In the era of large time-domain spectro-photometric surveys, surface variations such as starspots, chemical inhomogeneities, pulsations, rotational distortions, and binary interactions can now be directly detected and modelled. Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies.

Motivation: 准确测定晚型恒星外层大气的高能辐射光谱对于理解行星大气光蒸发、光化学过程以及年轻天体周围辐照盘建模至关重要，但目前缺乏高分辨率光谱观测手段。

Method: 利用哈勃太空望远镜和钱德拉/XMM-牛顿望远镜获取的FUV和X射线发射线光谱，推导出一组等离子体发射量分布，建立基于恒星表面X射线通量的EMD预测方法。

Result: 发现M型恒星在低于10^5K温度下发射量略低，而在高于10^6.5K温度下发射量高于具有相似表面X射线通量的FGK型恒星，且该方法考虑了恒星外层大气化学丰度不确定性。

Conclusion: 成功开发了基于表面X射线通量预测恒星XUV光谱的简单参数化方法，该方法考虑了光谱类型差异，为研究恒星活动对行星系统的影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: High-energy emission spectra from the outer atmospheres of late-type stars represent an important feature of the stellar activity in several contexts, such as the photoevaporation and photochemistry of planetary atmospheres or the modeling of irradiated circumstellar disks in young objects. An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below ~10^5 K and higher emission measures for T > ~10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres.

Abstract: Close companions influence stellar evolution through tidal interactions, mass transfer, and mass loss effects. While such companions are detected around young stellar objects, main-sequence stars, red giants, and compact objects, direct observational evidence of close-in companions around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has remained elusive. Here, we present (sub)millimeter time-domain imaging spectroscopy revealing the Keplerian motion of a close-in companion around the AGB star pi1 Gruis. The companion, slightly more massive than the AGB star, is likely a main-sequence star. Unlike more evolved stars with companions at comparable distances, pi1 Gru's companion follows a circular orbit, suggesting an eccentricity-generating mechanism late- or post-AGB. Our analysis suggests that model-predicted circularization rates may be underestimated. Our results highlight the potential of multi-epoch (sub)millimeter interferometry in detecting the Keplerian motion of close companions to giant stars and open avenues for our understanding of tidal interaction physics and binary evolution.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for characterizing nova candidates by exploiting the infrared capabilities of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog. We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.

Method: 利用银河系棒状势场中轨道角动量Z分量L_z的不变性破坏作为轨道混沌程度的指标，L_z变化越大表示轨道混沌程度越高。

Result: 展示了新方法与其他轨道分类方法结果的高度相关性，成功将半径3.5 kpc内的45个球状星团分为规则、混沌和弱混沌三类。

Conclusion: 提出的基于L_z变化分析的方法为轨道动力学研究提供了新的有效工具，能够可靠地识别球状星团的轨道混沌特性。

Abstract: It is shown how the violation of the invariance of the $Z$-component of the orbital angular momentum $L_z$ in the axially symmetric potential of the Galaxy with a bar can serve as an indicator of the degree of orbital chaos of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy. In this case, the higher the variations of $L_z$ of the orbit over a certain period of time, the higher the chaos of the orbit. In essence, a new method for analyzing orbital dynamics -- regular or chaotic -- is proposed. A high level of correlation between the results of orbit classification by the proposed method and the results of classification by other methods is shown. As a result, a sample of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc is divided into regular, chaotic, and weakly chaotic.

Motivation: 星系团最亮星系的外围区域包含其宿主暗物质晕组装历史和质量的重要信息，但由于表面亮度低而难以观测。需要确定测量晕质量的最佳恒星质量径向定义。

Method: 构建HSC模拟观测管道，测量IllustrisTNG模拟中BCG的恒星质量密度分布，系统测量不同环形区域内的恒星质量及其与晕质量的相关性。

Result: 发现简单孔径测量的恒星质量在恒星质量-晕质量关系中散射较大，确定了最佳径向范围（内半径70-200 kpc，外半径125-500 kpc），提出了基于Sérsic模型的拟合函数，中值误差为54%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了BCG恒星晕的拟合函数，可用于未来广域巡天中通过深空成像数据推断晕质量。

Abstract: The diffuse outskirts of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) encode valuable information about the assembly history and mass of their host dark matter halos. However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this "outskirt mass" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data.

Motivation: 理解JWST发现的'小红点'天体的本质，以确定它们在早期星系和超大质量黑洞演化中的位置。这些天体的性质挑战了传统星系或活动星系核的分类框架。

Conclusion: LRDs是包含星系和AGN的混合种群，其选择由AGN和星系辐射的相互作用驱动。没有证据支持超大质量黑洞主要来源于重种子，LRDs多为盘状星系，LRD AGNs具有更大的由盘不稳定性形成的核球。

Abstract: The enigmatic Little Red Dots (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibit properties challenging their interpretation as common galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% ($\sim10^{-4}\rm Mpc^{-3}$) at $z\sim4$. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning $M_*=10^8-10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$. A population of galaxies with $M_*<10^9\rm M_\odot$ appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions ($M_{\rm vir} > 10^{11.5}\rm M_\odot$, $M_* > 10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection. AGN dominate rest-frame UV-optical emission, while dust obscuration is secondary. LRDs host lighter MBHs ($\sim 10^{6.5}\rm M_\odot$) than non-LRDs ($\sim 10^{7.5}\rm M_\odot$), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks. We find no evidence for dominant heavy-seed origin of MBHs. LRD Galaxies (97% hosting MBHs) and LRD AGNs are disk-dominated, with LRD AGNs showing larger bulges formed mainly via disk instabilities.

Conclusion: 上升的恒星形成历史意味着常用的基于恒定SFR假设的亮度-SFR转换因子会高估这些星系的平均SFR，需要提供更新的校准因子。

Abstract: Reliable star formation rate (SFR) measurements are essential for understanding early galaxy evolution, yet derived values rely on several assumptions. To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~<~\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot})~<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$α$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\simeq3$. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the H$α$-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.

Abstract: Context. The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios.

Abstract: We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

Motivation: 探索在再电离时期，由于金属混合和富集的不均匀性，原始气体云中第三族恒星的形成特性及其质量分布如何随环境和宇宙时间变化。

Method: 使用POPSICLE项目的高分辨率（7.5 au）辐射磁流体动力学模拟，分别模拟暴露在z=30和z=6宇宙微波背景下的原始气体云，以及在z=6下具有强外部莱曼-维尔纳辐射背景的情况。

Result: 在没有外部LW辐射的情况下，z=6比z=30表现出更少的分裂，形成更小但中位质量更高的恒星团；在强外部LW辐射环境下，观察到剧烈的吸积和高恒星形成效率，形成超大质量恒星（M⋆ > 100 M⊙）。

Conclusion: 第三族恒星的初始质量函数可能仅因宇宙微波背景而随红移变化，与z≥20相比，再电离时期可能形成质量更小、更紧凑的第三族恒星团，在强辐射环境中可能形成超大质量恒星。

Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} > 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.

Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) are the only single stars in galaxies outside the Local Group that can be used as kinematic tracers of the diffuse light in the extended halo. Analysing their luminosity-specific number density across galaxies of different morphologies has also shown hints that they may be used as tracers of the age and metallicity of stellar populations. A proper understanding of this relation has been hindered by the fact that simultaneously detecting PNe and accurately measuring stellar properties is extremely difficult using classical narrow-band imaging methods, which cannot detect PNe in the bright centres of galaxies. In this work, we use integral-field spectroscopy to overcome this challenge, analysing the inner regions of a sample of ten early-type galaxies from the Extended Planetary Nebulae Survey (ePN.S) for which archival MUSE data was available. With the Diffuse Emission-Line Filter (DELF) technique, we automate the detection of PNe, and perform spectral fitting on the diffuse light to infer kinematics and stellar population parameters. We compare the PN number density profile and its associated alpha-parameter with multiple properties of the host galaxies. We find that our sample follows the previously observationally constrained correlation with the metallicity of the host galaxy. We find a weak anti-correlation between the alpha-parameter and the FUV excess, highlighting the possible relation between the visibility lifetime of PNe on the spectral energy distribution of their host galaxies, with fewer PNe detected in association with stellar populations characterized by a UV excess.

Abstract: Spitzer-based cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations at arcminute-to-degree scales indicate the presence of new populations, whereas sub-arcminute power arises from known $z\lesssim 6$ galaxies. We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $< 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $λ<2\ μ$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.
