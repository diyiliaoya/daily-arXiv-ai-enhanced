These mechanisms can induce flux variations of similar magnitudes, shapes, and periods. We aim to determine mechanisms responsible for the sinusoidal variations in main-sequence stars hotter than 6500 K. We conducted our analysis using TESS long-cadence data complemented with high-resolution spectra from three spectrographs. From the initial sample of almost 46000 objects, we selected 35 targets for spectroscopic follow-up. Comparison of light curves and radial velocity curves allowed for robust classification of these targets. Among the 35 selected objects, 18 displayed variability, suggesting the presence of a companion (including the discovery of 7 new binary systems and 1 candidate for a triple-star system), 1 was identified as a new pulsator, 9 as new candidates for spotted stars, and 7 objects had uncertain classification. Our analysis shows that at least half of randomly selected stars with sinusoidal brightness variations are binaries. The presented results illustrate the need for an individual approach to stellar classification, especially in cases where the photometric data alone is insufficient for determining the underlying phenomena behind the observed variations."}

We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type."}

This increases by more than an order of magnitude the ensemble of binary stars with known characteristics, which previously numbered about 140 thousand pairs. To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results."}

Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty.

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture."}

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}

The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission."}

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities > -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value."}

We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data.

We compiled and analyzed Two-Line Element (TLE) datasets from Space-Track.org and historical collision data using a Python-based data mining approach. Specifically, we derived satellite velocities using the Vis-Viva equation and evaluated the correlation of five key features, launch piece count, orbital period, apogee, perigee, and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size, with debris density. Our evaluation reveals that apogee and orbital period exhibit the strongest correlation with the risk of the Kessler Syndrome, indicating that satellites in higher orbits pose a disproportionately greater threat to long-term sustainability due to navigational constraints. Contrary to common assumptions, our data suggests that velocity and object size (RCS) show negligible direct correlation with collision incidence in the current dataset.

Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions. This work emphasizes the critical role of multi-wavelength validation in classifying interacting systems to avoid misinterpretation due to projection effects."}

J. van Weeren"], "title": "Lossless compression of simulated radio interferometric visibilities", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 8 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Context. Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm."}

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities > -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value."}

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector."}

In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs.

Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands."}

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($ε$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems."}

The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs."}

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}

The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $Φ_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $ρ_b$ generates an additional energy density $ρ_s = μ_s Φ_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $Φ_{\\rm tot}$, \\[ \\nabla^2Φ_{\\rm tot} = 4πG\\,ρ_b /c^2 + 4πG\\,μ_s\\,Φ_b^2 / c^6. \\] When assuming $μ_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied."}

IV. Candidate Selection from Chandra with Random Forest", "comment": "ApJ, submitted", "summary": "Quasar samples remain severely incomplete at low Galactic latitudes because of strong extinction and source confusion. We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs."}

J1244-LyC1 has a highly significant ($10σ$) LyC detection, corresponding to an absolute escape fraction of $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\! =\\!36\\%\\pm4\\%$ ($1σ$). The LyC emission is spatially resolved into multiple peaks that coincide with the system's disturbed morphology, confirming genuine multi-site LyC leakage.

This discovery provides the first direct evidence of spatially resolved LyC escape in a merging system, offering new insight into the potential role of major mergers in driving the cosmic reionization."}

Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands."}

We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\\arcsec\\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation."}

Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate.

To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected.
