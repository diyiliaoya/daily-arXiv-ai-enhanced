However, studying its innermost regions is\nchallenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red\nclump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes\nsuggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new\ninsights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We\nevaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction\ndistributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and\nextinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening\nproperties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated\nusing N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC\nfeatures are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference\nof $-0.16\\pm0.02\\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane.\nThis difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at\ndifferent distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards\nthe secondary RC is also $\\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC.\nAdditionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC\nfeatures corresponds to only $\\sim5\\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to\nthe first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge\nof the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the\nsecondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\\pm0.07$,\nconsistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across\nfields or along the line of sight.

When detected as radio\nsources, their luminosities correlate with the magnetic field and rotation.\nRotation is crucial because the mechanism undergirding the relativistic\nelectron production is powered by centrifugal breakouts. CBOs occur wherever\nmagnetic tension does not balance centrifugal force; the resulting magnetic\nreconnection provides particle acceleration. To investigate how physical\nconditions at the site of the CBOs affect the efficiency of the acceleration\nmechanism, we broadly explore the parameter space governing radio emission by\nincreasing the sample of radio-loud magnetic stars. High-sensitivity VLA\nobservations of 32 stars were performed in the hope of identifying new\ncentrifugal magnetospheres and associated CBOs. We calculated gyro-synchrotron\nspectra using 3D modeling of a dipole-shaped magnetosphere. We evaluated\ncombinations of parameters. The number of relativistic electrons was\nconstrained by the need to produce the emission level predicted by the scaling\nrelationship for the radio emission from magnetic BA stars. About half of the\nobserved stars were detected, with luminosities in agreement with the expected\nvalues, reinforcing the robust nature of the scaling relationship for\nCBO-powered radio emission. Comparing the competing centrifugal and magnetic\neffects on plasma locked in a rigidly rotating magnetosphere, we located the\nsite of CBOs and inferred the local plasma density. We then estimated the\nefficiency of the acceleration mechanism needed to produce enough non-thermal\nelectrons to support the radio emission level. Given a constant acceleration\nefficiency, relativistic electrons represent a fixed fraction of the local\nthermal plasma. Thus, dense magnetospheres host more energetic particles than\nless dense ones; consequently, with other parameters similar, they are\nintrinsically brighter radio sources."}

We aim to validate the new radiative MHD code MAGEC,\nwhich combines the MANCHA and MAGNUS codes into a finite-volume,\nshock-capturing framework, and to test its performance through 2D simulations\nof magneto-convection.\n  MAGEC is MPI-parallelized and includes improvements for coronal modeling,\nsuch as LTE radiative losses and a hyperbolic treatment of thermal conduction\nthat mitigates restrictive time steps. We also estimated its numerical\nviscosity and resistivity. To assess robustness, we performed 2D simulations\ncovering a domain from 2 Mm below the surface to 18.16 Mm into the corona,\nusing both open and closed magnetic-field configurations. For each case, we\nanalyzed steady-state temperature profiles and the contributions to the\ninternal-energy balance at different heights. A separate experiment examined\nthe role of perpendicular thermal conduction.\n  MAGEC reproduced the expected temperature stratification set by boundary\nconditions and magnetic geometry, and all simulations reached thermal\nequilibrium. Open-field cases produced higher coronal temperatures than closed,\narcade-like fields. Analysis of the explicit and implicit energy terms\nclarified their relative effects on heating and cooling. Perpendicular thermal\nconduction, often neglected in coronal models, was found to influence plasma\ndynamics near reconnection; although local effects are small, they can\ncumulatively modify the average coronal temperature.\n  These results show that MAGEC is a reliable and efficient tool for radiative\nMHD simulations, well suited to capturing the shocks and dynamic processes of\nthe solar atmosphere."}

To\nexperimentally distinguish modes of heating, acceleration, and turbulence in\nthe solar wind, precise representations of particle phase space VDFs are\nneeded. In the first paper of this series, we developed the Slepian Basis\nReconstruction (SBR) method to approximate fully agyrotropic continuous\ndistributions from discrete measurements of electrostatic analyzers (ESAs). The\nmethod enables accurate determination of plasma moments, preserves kinetic\nfeatures, and prescribes smooth gradients in phase space. In this paper, we\nextend the SBR method by imposing gyrotropic symmetry (g-SBR). Incorporating\nthis symmetry enables high-fidelity reconstruction of VDFs that are partially\nmeasured, as from an ESA with a limited field-of-view (FOV). We introduce three\nframeworks for g-SBR, the gyrotropic Slepian Basis Reconstruction: (A) 1D\nangular Slepian functions on a polar-cap, (B) 2D Slepian functions in a\nCartesian plane, and (C) a hybrid method. We employ model distributions\nrepresenting multiple anisotropic ion populations in the solar wind to\nbenchmark these methods, and we show that the g-SBR method produces a\nreconstruction that preserves kinetic structures and plasma moments, even with\na strongly limited FOV. For our choice of model distribution, g-SBR can recover\n$\\geq90\\%$ of the density when only $20\\%$ is measured. We provide the package\n\\texttt{gdf} for open-source use and contribution by the heliophysics\ncommunity. This work establishes direct pathways to bridge particle\nobservations with kinetic theory and simulations, facilitating the\ninvestigation of gyrotropic plasma heating phenomena across the heliosphere."}

The lags increase with wavelength, as\nexpected from reprocessing of central high-energy emission by surrounding\nmaterial. Our lag spectrum is much shallower than that obtained from an optical\nmonitoring campaign conducted a year earlier when MCG+08-11-11 was\napproximately 4 times brighter. After filtering out long-term trends in the\nearlier optical lightcurves we recover shorter lags consistent with our own -\ndemonstrating concurrent reverberation signals from different spatial scales\nand the luminosity dependence of the measured lags. We use our lag spectrum to\ntest several physical models, finding that disc reprocessing models cannot\naccount for the observed 'excess' lags in the u and r-i-bands that are highly\nindicative of the Balmer and Paschen continua produced by reprocessing in the\nbroad line region (BLR) gas. The structure seen in both the variable (rms) and\nlag spectra, and the large time delay between X-ray and UV variations\n(approximately 2 days) all suggest that the BLR is the dominant reprocessor.\nThe hard X-ray spectrum (Gamma approximately 1.7) and faint, red, UV-optical\nspectrum both indicate that the Eddington accretion ratio is low: approximately\n0.03. The bolometric luminosity then requires that the black hole mass is\nsubstantially greater than current reverberation mapping derived estimates."}

We train a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph\nrepresentation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict\nthe mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending\non the graph complexity and node features.
