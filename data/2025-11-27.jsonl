Three of the four CO emitters are multiple images of the same galaxy. Compared to previous line-emitter searches in ALMA deep fields, our sample probes molecular gas masses $\\sim$1 dex below the lower bound, thanks to gravitational lensing (typically $μ\\sim 4$, up to $\\sim$30 in extreme cases). Most emitters are located in a region similar to normal star-forming galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus molecular gas mass plane. To reduce dependence on SFR and stellar mass, we analyzed the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence. We found that most emitters broadly follow the scaling relations from previous studies, consistent within the intrinsic scatter. In addition, we serendipitously detected the CH $N = 1$, $J = 3/2 \\rightarrow 1/2$ $Λ$-doublet transition from one CO emitter at $z = 1.142$, representing the first detection of CH from an individual galaxy at cosmological distances through a blind survey. The CH/CO column density ratio of $\\sim$$10^{-4}$ is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays."}

Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 < z < 15.0$.

ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets.

We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate."}

The current paradigm invokes outflows driven by photon scattering on relatively large grains ($\\sim0.3\\,μ$m), but whether such grains exist in sufficient quantities remains uncertain.\n  We test whether the dust around the oxygen-rich AGB star R~Doradus can drive its wind by combining polarimetric constraints, elemental abundance limits, and force-balance calculations. We examine Fe-free silicates (MgSiO$_3$), alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), and Fe-bearing silicates (MgFeSiO$_4$) to evaluate whether any species can produce enough radiative pressure under realistic conditions.\n  Using high-angular-resolution polarimetric observations from SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the VLT, we model the circumstellar dust with RADMC-3D and explore a broad parameter space in grain size, density structure, and wavelength-dependent stellar radius. For models consistent with the observations, we assess wind feasibility using updated gas-density profiles, elemental depletion constraints, and radiation-pressure thresholds.\n  Although several dust configurations reproduce the observed scattering patterns, none generate sufficient radiative force at realistic gas-to-dust ratios, even under maximal elemental depletion. Our results for R~Doradus indicate that photon scattering on dust cannot by itself launch the wind, implying that additional mechanisms must contribute."}

The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks.

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10$μ$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10$μ$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime."}

The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses."}

These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)."}

We use 17 simulated low-mass galaxies from the Auriga Project ($\\sim 3 \\times 10^8 \\, M_\\odot \\leq M_* \\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$). We study the metallicity and the ages of these galaxies and their stellar halos, as well as the relation between these two properties. We find that all galaxies have negative radial [Fe/H] gradients, and that the centres of less massive dwarfs are generally more metal poor than those of more massive dwarfs. We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime. We also find that the dispersion in the mass-metallicity relation found in the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies can be explained with the infall time of their most dominant satellite: at a fixed accreted stellar halo mass, dwarf galaxies that accreted this satellite at later times have more metal-rich accreted stellar halos. Regarding the ages of the analysed galaxies, we find a prominent U-shape in the radial mean age profiles of $\\sim 65\\%$ of them, which is mainly driven by the in situ stellar material. This presence of a U-shape in the age profiles is due to the combination of the cessation of recent star formation at large radial distances and the merger events these galaxies undergo, which redistribute the stellar material to their outer regions. When focusing on the ages of the stellar halos, we find that more massive ones are older than less massive ones. Our results show a wide variety in ages and metallicities of low-mass galaxies and their stellar halos, reflecting the complex and non-uniform evolutionary pathways these systems can follow."}

We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \\kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\\%.

COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup).

Here we present the empirical relation between SFR and broadband optical-to-NIR colors learned from Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging using an innovative stacking analysis that bins galaxies with similar optical-to-NIR spectral energy distributions using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Stacking based on optical-to-NIR colors ensures that our FIR stacks are built from galaxies with similar intrinsic physical properties as opposed to stacking simply by stellar mass. We train a 40$\\times$40 SOM using 230,638 galaxies selected from the COSMOS field, and stack the mid-to-far infrared images from 24 micron to 500 micron.

In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency on the $ΔP_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \\, M_\\odot < M < 3 \\, M_{\\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $ΔP_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $ΔP_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\\sim 2 \\, M_\\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $ΔP_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $ΔP_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $ΔP_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $γ$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates."}

Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency."}

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Migration typically occurs during the formation of planets and is closely linked to the planetary formation process. In classical theories of non-accreting planetary migration, both type I and type II migration typically result in inward migration, which is hard to align with the architecture of the planetary systems.In this work, we conduct systematic, high-resolution 3D/2D numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the migration of an accreting planet. Under different disk conditions, we compared the dynamical evolution of planets with different planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that accretion of planets can significantly diminish the inward migration tendency of planets, or even change the migration direction. The migration of low-/high-mass planets is classified as Type I/II inward migration, respectively, while intermediate-mass planets, which have the strongest accretion, show an outward migration trend. We confirm that the outward migration is mainly attributed to the positive torque from the azimuthal asymmetric structures around the accreting planet, similar to Li et al. (2024). The termination of planetary mass growth is thus synonymous with the transition from outward to inward migration. For the high viscosity $α=0.04$ and disk aspect ratio height $h_0=0.05$ cases, the mass ratio range for planetary outward migration is $1\\times10^{-4}\\lesssim q\\lesssim4\\times10^{-3}$. For the low viscosity case with $α=0.001$, and/or the low disk aspect ratio cases $h_0=0.03$, the mass ratio range for the outward migration will shift toward the lower end. Our parameter survey reveals that a simple gap opening parameter determines the outward migration condition; details of the analytical interpretation are presented in Ida et al. (2025)."}

This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations.

By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3.

With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap."}

Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1$\\times$10^{5} km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma."}

While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres."}

We find that nucleated dEs are more spatially clustered and exhibit a stronger association with massive galaxies than their non-nucleated counterparts. This suggests that most nucleated dEs likely formed alongside massive galaxies within the cluster (i.e, the in-situ formation). In contrast, non-nucleated dEs are more widely distributed across the cluster and align more closely with Virgo's global potential well, as traced by the cluster's hot gas. This indicates that most non-nucleated dEs originated outside the cluster (i.e, the ex-situ formation) and were later accreted and redistributed within it.

Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies."}

The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies."}

Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS. We perform the fitting for CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_3$CN.

We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems."}

We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) by combining the Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 $μ$m imaging data to examine the relationship between molecular gas and SFR densities on scales of several hundred parsecs. We find that the power-law slope of the molecular SFL ranges from 0.62 to 1.08, with an average value of N$=0.81\\pm0.18$, increasing to N$=0.87\\pm0.05$ when excluding galaxies with poorly constrained CO data. These results are roughly consistent with values observed in massive spiral galaxies, suggesting a universal molecular SFL when analyzed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity. Radial profiles of the Toomre $Q$ parameter remain close to unity across the disks, with minimal radial variation, consistent with a self-regulated star formation model. Our results suggest that, despite their lower mass and metallicity, star formation in dwarf galaxies is governed by the same fundamental physical processes as in larger systems.

New observations have expanded this category, with the addition of a Huntsman group, tentatively linked to a short donor phase along the red bump in the secondary evolutionary track. We present explicit evolutionary tracks that support the Huntsman nature recently suggested, and discuss how the whole class of spiders emerges from the full consideration of irradiation and ablating winds. We address the irradiation feedback (IFB) effects and the hydrogen-shell burning detachment (HSBD) simultaneously, and show that they act independently and do not interfere with each other, supporting a physical picture of the Huntsman group. We employ our binary evolution code to compute a suite of binary systems formed by a donor star and a neutron star for different initial orbital periods, assuming solar composition and Z=0.01. Although many models do not consider IFB, we also present the evolution with IFB for one system as an example. We found that the recently suggested association of Huntsman pulsar with the evolutionary stage where (as a consequence of the dynamics of HSBD) the system remains detached for a few million years is plausible. However, this feature alone is unable to account for the occurrence of Redback spider pulsars. Meanwhile, models including IFB, with pulsed mass transfer, display detachment episodes that can be naturally associated with the Redback stage. Irradiation feedback does not preclude or modify HSBD and in fact, Huntsman systems were already present as an implicit prediction in our earlier calculations. We conclude that Huntsman is an expected stage of the spider systems under quite general conditions. This is another step towards a unified picture of spider pulsars as a group."}

The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses."}

Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed."}

Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency."}

However, observational measurements of this `burst mass fraction' are scant. Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers."}

We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate."}

COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup).

We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems."}

By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys."}

Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency."}

These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)."}

Since YSOs and AGB stars share similar infrared (IR) photometric characteristics due to comparable temperatures and the presence of circumstellar dust, distinguishing them is challenging and often leads to misclassification. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy. This approach uncovered YSOs and AGB stars that were misclassified in IR photometry and was validated against Taurus YSOs and spectroscopically confirmed AGB stars. We applied the model to the {\\it Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane} (SPICY) catalog for catalog refinement and identified potential AGB star contaminants."}

Interstellar and circumstellar matter, 15 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables, in press", "summary": "Shock types of low-velocity molecular outflows are not always well constrained. Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies."}
